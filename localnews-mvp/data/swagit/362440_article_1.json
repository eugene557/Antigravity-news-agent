    "article": "Jupiter's latest council meeting turned into a celebration of young talent as winners of the Centennial Art and Poetry Contest were honored. This event, aimed at cultivating local pride and community spirit, featured the artistic and poetic interpretations of what Jupiter means to its student participants.\n\nThe contest, organized by the town's Planning and Zoning Department, invited students from kindergarten to high school to showcase their creativity through art and poetry. As senior planner and Historic Resources Board liaison Thatcher Hart explained, the contest encouraged students to express their vision of Jupiter, fostering a deeper connection with their community.\n\nThe event was supported by the Loxahatchee Guild and the Palm Beach County Library system. Kim Ryan from the Loxahatchee Guild expressed pride in collaborating on the project, emphasizing the joy of supporting young artists.\n\nWinners included Oliver in Division 1 (K-2nd grade), Ethan Tagle in Division 2 (3rd-5th grade), Payton Lau in the middle school division, and Alice Lin in the high school category. Their artworks, along with others, are set to be displayed at the Jupiter Branch Library, allowing the public to appreciate the young talents.\n\nMayor Jim Kuretski and council members Ronnie Doane, Cheryl Schneider, Cameron May, and Malise Sundstrom joined the celebration, underscoring their support for initiatives that promote community pride and involvement. The council also expressed gratitude towards the parents and families that encourage their children's participation in such enriching activities.\n\nAs the town continues to honor its centennial, events like these not only highlight the creativity of young residents but also strengthen community bonds. The success of the contest promises future efforts to engage and inspire Jupiter's youth, with further activities planned in the centennial celebration series.\n\nNext, the town will focus on other centennial events, including bus tours, open houses, and a children's archaeological event at Sawfish Bay Park, ensuring the celebration of Jupiter's history and community spirit continues.",
