we gather here today with gratitude and a commitment to service as we conduct business.

10
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.900
May you guide us and grant us wisdom to be

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.520
good stewards of the resources entrusted to us,

12
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.470

>> Here.

32
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.650
>> Thank you. We begin tonight.

33
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.140
First item on the agenda,

34
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.870
we have an exciting item.

35
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.870
It's presentation on the Centennial Art and Poetry Contest winners.

36
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.060
>> Good evening, council and members of the public here.

37
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.850
We have an exciting item for you tonight.

38
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.040
Let me just pull it up here,

39
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.600
on our art and poetry contest.

40
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.960
Our department, Planning and Zoning,

41
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:19.400
has done over 20 events for celebrating the centennial, starting in January.

42
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.175
We've got one next week coming up, hopefully,

43
00:02:24.175 --> 00:02:28.720
if we can get another two bus tours and open house and

44
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.800
a children's archaeological event next week at the Sawfish Bay Park.

45
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.100
But tonight, we want to talk about celebrating

46
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.440
the students who submitted for the art and poetry contest,

47
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.020
and with us today is Thatcher Hart.

48
00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.240
He is senior planner and Historic Resources Board liaison.

49
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.340
I'm going to open this up. There we go.

50
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.810
>> Good evening, council, pleasure to be here.

51
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.430
This is an exciting item that we can be here and celebrate.

52
00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.550
As mentioned by Stephanie Thoburn,

53
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.990
the art and poetry contest here was for students in the area.

54
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.470
What we were working with is that we gave the students in

55
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.600
the area a prompt of what does Jupiter mean to them.

56
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:32.250
With that, they had to provide a piece of art for K through fifth grade.

57
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.230
Then they also had to submit a piece of art as well as a essay

58
00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.270
or a piece of poetry to go along with the art,

59
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.470
describing the art and going with the same theme of what Jupiter really means to them.

60
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.540
Like I said, it was for students within the Jupiter area.

61
00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.550
It was open to anyone that was willing to apply for both private,

62
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.575
public, and home-schooled students.

63
00:03:54.575 --> 00:03:57.710
It was, in collaboration,

64
00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.790
judged by the Town of Jupiter Art Committee.

65
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.790
We worked with them, and they went through

66
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.270
the submissions and worked to determine who would win the awards.

67
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.900
We broke down the submissions into four divisions.

68
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.080
The first division was kindergarten through second grade,

69
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.140
and they were required to submit one piece of art only.

70
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.100
Division 2 is third grade through fifth grade, with one piece of art.

71
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.380
Then for the middle school division,

72
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.380
they were required to submit the one piece of art as well as

73
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.580
one essay or piece of poetry to go along with their artwork.

74
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.880
As well as high school,

75
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:38.140
they had to provide a piece of art as well as one essay piece of poetry.

76
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.300
Really important to mention that we couldn't do

77
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.460
this with our sponsors, the Loxahatchee Guild.

78
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.120
They were graciously supportive of this effort

79
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.000
and providing us the awards that the students will receive tonight.

80
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.770
Kim Ryan here is tonight and representing Loxahatchee Guild,

81
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.145
as well as Mary Therese.

82
00:04:55.145 --> 00:04:58.780
We're really grateful for them to provide support for this effort.

83
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.500
As well, we collaborated with the Palm Beach County Library system

84
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.620
and worked with Bernadette Dickson to work with them and

85
00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.320
we will be presenting or displaying the artwork that won

86
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.560
tonight's contest at the Jupiter Branch Library as well for the public to see.

87
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.290
We'll start with Division 1,

88
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:21.950
which is kindergarten through second grade.

89
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.850
We'll call up the winners here and we have a nice little goody bag for them. I'm sorry?

90
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.335
>> If I may come up?

91
00:05:28.335 --> 00:05:34.295
>> Yes, please. Do you want to do the honors?

92
00:05:34.295 --> 00:05:38.045
>> You want me to say something?

93
00:05:38.045 --> 00:05:39.390
>> Sure.

94
00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.585

We're proud of what you've accomplished and what we've accomplished.

00:05:58.665 --> 00:06:00.690
It was fun to do this.

101
00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.270
I'm a retired guidance counselor,

102
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.090
so it's fun to see kids again.

103
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.470

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:52.130
to some of the efforts taken by JPD staff on the anchored vessel issue,

180
00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:56.870
and also some of our plans moving forward with the program.

181
00:12:56.870 --> 00:13:00.430
We're going to start with some of the removals that have occurred over the past year.

182
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:03.510
We'll talk about what the current situation looks like,

183
00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:08.190
what anchored vessels are currently within Jupiter's waterways and their locations.

184
00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:11.410
We're going to discuss a new program that launched a couple of months ago,

185
00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:13.610
called Operation Barnacle Busters.

186
00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:18.110
Then we'll conclude with legislative update on two major House bills

187
00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:23.610
that have gone through the legislature and have or are going to take effect shortly.

188
00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:29.095
To start with, look at the derelict vessel removals over the past year.

189
00:13:29.095 --> 00:13:34.345
The Jupiter Police Marine Unit has coordinated the removal of three vessels; one,

190
00:13:34.345 --> 00:13:35.895
August 1st of '25,

191
00:13:35.895 --> 00:13:39.905
and the other two were back in March of '25.

192
00:13:39.905 --> 00:13:42.430
That's consistent with the prior year.

193
00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:46.130
There were three vessels removed also that year as well.

194
00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:48.520
Again, those vessels were the Billy B,

195
00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.250
the Obsession II, and Last Fling.

196
00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:55.180
Current status of vessels inside Jupiter's waterways,

197
00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:59.730
we had the marine unit go out and give us a status of where we sit today with vessels.

198
00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:01.570
You'll see the majority of the vessels in

199
00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:05.130
the Top 2 categories there sit in the intercoastal waterway,

200
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:06.570
south of Indiantown Road,

201
00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:07.770
just south of the bridge.

202
00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:11.930
Then there were 12 in the area of Burt Reynolds West.

203
00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:14.110
There were a couple of vessels in other locations,

204
00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:19.730
but they seem to be congregating in those two main areas of the town's waterways.

205
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:27.040
There we go. To talk about Operation Barnacle Busters,

206
00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:31.200
and we've introduced this in some prior meetings in very vague terms,

207
00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:35.315
but I want to take a second to go through and tell you where it came from.

208
00:14:35.315 --> 00:14:38.580
Members of our marine unit and our dive team came up with

209
00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:43.320
the idea to inspect vessels' means of propulsion,

210
00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.660
which is one of the requirements by

211
00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:48.265
Florida State Statute that a vessel have an effective means of propulsion.

212
00:14:48.265 --> 00:14:52.230
To do that, we always had concerns about whether we were

213
00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:55.770
going to have people test their propulsion from a safety factor.

214
00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:57.790
If we're saying they can't propulse,

215
00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:59.990
what is the way to do that safely?

216
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:01.990
Well, our staff came up with an idea to

217
00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:05.150
utilize our underwater recovery team, our dive team,

218
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:09.110
to go underwater and take photos and try to inspect

219
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:13.530
these propulsion systems from a more manual standpoint.

220
00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:16.690
We began this in September of 2025.

221
00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:18.570
During that first inspection,

222
00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:23.540
there were 18 written warnings issued for not having effective means of propulsion.

223
00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.665
Now you'll see on the right-hand side of the slide there,

224
00:15:26.665 --> 00:15:32.830
that's two photos of two of the prop systems that the marine unit and dive team located.

225
00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:36.290
They actually went up and physically tried to manipulate

226
00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:40.690
those props and found that they were not able to turn and not able to move.

227
00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:44.465
There were 18 written warnings issued in September of 2025.

228
00:15:44.465 --> 00:15:49.490
The following month, as we're enforcing this,

229
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:55.940
the statute requires a minimum of 30 days between violations,

230
00:15:55.940 --> 00:16:01.370
so we weren't able to go out and do the next round of inspections until October of 2025.

231
00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:03.430
During that, of the 18,

232
00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:07.230
nine were remaining with violations in our waterways.

233
00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:10.750
Nine citations were written for that violation.

234
00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:14.970
Those nine citations will be the first level

235
00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:20.590
of three citations that could possibly lead to a designation of an at-risk vessel,

236
00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:24.170
which then would start the process of removal.

237
00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:26.890
Again, we're one round of citations through this.

238
00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:29.990
We have a second round of inspections,

239
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:32.130
which technically be our third round,

240
00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:34.970
but our second round of citation inspections.

241
00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:37.150
That will take place December 9th.

242
00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:39.900
That's already coordinated with our underwater recovery team,

243
00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.320
and our marine needs to go do those inspections.

244
00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:47.060
We'll be following up with all of the vessels in Jupiter's waterways on a monthly basis,

245
00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:49.680
particularly those with violations.

246
00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:53.340
Once a vessel comes into compliance,

247
00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:56.100
we'll look at inspecting that vessel quarterly,

248
00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:58.260
just to make sure that once they've resolved

249
00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.640
the condition that caused them to be in violation,

250
00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.140
we want to make sure it stays there.

251
00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:06.100
Those will be put on a quarterly inspection process.

252
00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:10.690
>> Again, I mentioned at the beginning,

253
00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:12.700
there were two new house bills that passed.

254
00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:17.755
This one, House Bill 481 took effect already July 1 of 2025.

255
00:17:17.755 --> 00:17:21.265
This house bill allows local municipalities,

256
00:17:21.265 --> 00:17:27.295
specifically municipalities and counties that have a population of 1,500,000. or more,

257
00:17:27.295 --> 00:17:30.745
which limits it to four coastal counties: Hillsboro,

258
00:17:30.745 --> 00:17:34.450
Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami Dale.

259
00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:36.580
Orange County also meets the definition.

260
00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:39.910
However, the more inland and don't really apply here.

261
00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:42.175
I will tell you the current statute,

262
00:17:42.175 --> 00:17:47.035
what it actually requires is a little ambiguous.

263
00:17:47.035 --> 00:17:50.630
At the time they're still working through some definitions on it.

264
00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.080
But what it basically requires,

265
00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:57.400
it allows us to create an ordinance that regulates overnight anchoring to where

266
00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:03.200
a vessel cannot anchor for more than 30 days in a six month period.

267
00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:08.635
Now, a couple of questions I have with that,

268
00:18:08.635 --> 00:18:12.280
is it 30 consecutive days in that six month period,

269
00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.275
and is it in the same location?

270
00:18:14.275 --> 00:18:17.020
For instance, if somebody's anchored at Burt Reynolds Park,

271
00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:21.070
and they relocate down south of Indian Town Road Bridge,

272
00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:23.245
does that start the clock all over again?

273
00:18:23.245 --> 00:18:31.300
The statute is not clear at this point on what we're allowed to regulate in that case,

274
00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:34.300
there's still some clarity that has to be done on that.

275
00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:35.800
One other thing to mention with

276
00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:39.400
House Bill 481 and the possible creation of that ordinance,

277
00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:44.665
possible violations would be dealt with through the Municipal ordinance citation system.

278
00:18:44.665 --> 00:18:48.040
Those municipal citations would not count

279
00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:53.650
towards the consecutive violation rule that would lead to removal.

280
00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:56.260
Therefore, if we were to create an ordinance here,

281
00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:00.820
it would not advance towards removal of that vessel,

282
00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:05.125
it would only follow our municipal citation system.

283
00:19:05.125 --> 00:19:07.960
There are only two municipalities that have

284
00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:10.960
currently enacted ordinances under this house bill.

285
00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:14.905
One is Miami Dale and the other is the town of Palm Beach,

286
00:19:14.905 --> 00:19:18.310
due to the fact that this is new since it started in July,

287
00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:20.380
there's been limited results and

288
00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:26.845
limited reviews on how efficient it is in taking care of anchored vessel problem.

289
00:19:26.845 --> 00:19:30.130
Staff will continue to monitor those two ordinances and

290
00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:35.990
any future changes to this House bill to see if it adds any more clarity moving forward.

291
00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:39.085
The other House bill,

292
00:19:39.085 --> 00:19:40.615
House Bill 1149,

293
00:19:40.615 --> 00:19:42.250
this one has not yet taken effect,

294
00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:43.450
but is scheduled to take effect,

295
00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:46.030
January 1 of 2026.

296
00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:50.215
This is more of a state level bill versus the ordinance.

297
00:19:50.215 --> 00:19:53.230
This creates a permit process that is coordinated by

298
00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:57.250
the Fish and Wildlife Commission that would allow vessels to apply for,

299
00:19:57.250 --> 00:20:00.920
and obtain a long term anchoring permit.

300
00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:06.985
The way they defined long term anchoring is you can anchor any,

301
00:20:06.985 --> 00:20:08.200
this gets a little confusing,

302
00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:12.625
but it's anywhere within a one nautical mile of a documented anchorage point.

303
00:20:12.625 --> 00:20:14.740
Basically, to put it in simple terms,

304
00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:19.690
if I anchor outside Burt Reynolds and I call the state to get a permit,

305
00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:21.970
and they issue me that permit then that

306
00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:24.100
long term anchoring permit allows me to anchor anywhere

307
00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:29.455
within 1.15 miles of Burt Reynolds Park of where I was.

308
00:20:29.455 --> 00:20:32.740
That would be something where we don't have any say

309
00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:35.485
in who gets the permits or how the permits are issued.

310
00:20:35.485 --> 00:20:38.125
Those are strictly issued by Fish and Wildlife.

311
00:20:38.125 --> 00:20:40.630
We've been in communication with Fish and Wildlife.

312
00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:43.690
They're still in the process of creating

313
00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:47.365
this permit process and identifying what that looks like.

314
00:20:47.365 --> 00:20:50.080
Staff have been constantly reaching out to

315
00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.570
them to check to see if they've made any progress,

316
00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:55.855
where they sit with it and what exactly that looks like.

317
00:20:55.855 --> 00:20:59.770
I will tell you that any violations, say, for example,

318
00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:02.665
somebody was anchoring within Jupiter's Waterways,

319
00:21:02.665 --> 00:21:05.290
and they did not have one of these permits,

320
00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:07.690
and they violate that long term anchoring rule,

321
00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:10.690
it would result in a uniform boating citation,

322
00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:13.480
which is a state level citation that would then count

323
00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.945
towards subsequent violations toward removal.

324
00:21:16.945 --> 00:21:23.695
This would give us the opportunity to evaluate that for subsequent violations.

325
00:21:23.695 --> 00:21:27.310
We will continue to monitor the implementation of this statute,

326
00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:31.165
as like I said, the program is not fully fleshed out by the state at this point,

327
00:21:31.165 --> 00:21:35.110
but we're going to keep our eyes on this thing and see if that may

328
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:39.980
be the most efficient option for the town moving forward.

329
00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:43.420
Some key takeaways,

330
00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:47.585
Police Department remains proactive in vessel monitoring and enforcement efforts.

331
00:21:47.585 --> 00:21:49.590
The Barnacle Busters operation.

332
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:52.620
Again, I give credit to the Marine Unit and our underwater recovery team

333
00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:56.295
for putting that together and having the idea to think outside the box,

334
00:21:56.295 --> 00:22:00.610
and come up with a solution to try to help us manage this.

335
00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:04.330
Then Police Department staff is continuing monitoring new and proposed legislation,

336
00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:08.545
including House Bill 481 and 1149.

337
00:22:08.545 --> 00:22:12.940
With that, I can take any questions you may have regarding the new legislation,

338
00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:15.710
Barnacle busters or our activities so far.

339
00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:17.430
>> Counsel, have any questions?

340
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:19.830
>> I have a couple of questions. On your page 5,

341
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:22.830
chief, you mentioned the 18 written.

342
00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:25.530
Well, first of all, are people living on these boats?

343
00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:26.990
>> Some of them, yes.

344
00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:31.000
>> Do you know if are they residents of the town or there's out of town folks?

345
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.925
[OVERLAPPING] Come down the warm weather or?

346
00:22:33.925 --> 00:22:37.645
>> I don't know where they live, the specific boats.

347
00:22:37.645 --> 00:22:41.785
>> On the 18 written warnings and 9 citations,

348
00:22:41.785 --> 00:22:44.080
were those 9 written warnings?

349
00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.690
Were they corrected then so you didn't have for any more citations?

350
00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:47.995
>> Some of them were corrected.

351
00:22:47.995 --> 00:22:51.070
Some of the people fixed the problem that we identified,

352
00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:54.145
and some of them had moved on to other locations.

353
00:22:54.145 --> 00:22:56.935
>> My last question,

354
00:22:56.935 --> 00:23:01.165
under that create the permitting process that the State may be looking at,

355
00:23:01.165 --> 00:23:05.875
do those vessels as part of their permitting process have to show operability?

356
00:23:05.875 --> 00:23:09.910
>> They do not. There is a stipulation in

357
00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:14.395
the statute that if those vessels do become derelict at any point or at risk,

358
00:23:14.395 --> 00:23:16.855
then that permit it will be vacated,

359
00:23:16.855 --> 00:23:18.250
so they will lose their permit,

360
00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:21.610
but that's going through the full derelict process as we would now.

361
00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:24.910
There's no scheduled regular inspections required.

362
00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:28.160
>> Thank you. Good presentation. I appreciate the answers too.

363
00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:30.745
>> Counsel San any questions.

364
00:23:30.745 --> 00:23:36.040
>> No questions. I just want to say that I greatly appreciate this police department.

365
00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.315
I appreciate your leadership,

366
00:23:37.315 --> 00:23:40.795
Chief Hennessy, for being so proactive.

367
00:23:40.795 --> 00:23:44.860
I mean, from being in touch with FWC on this House bill and

368
00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:49.240
following up with them constantly to proactively checking,

369
00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:51.175
using the dive teams, all of that.

370
00:23:51.175 --> 00:23:54.220
I just want to say it's very impressive. Thank you.

371
00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:55.120
>> Thank you.

372
00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.320
>> Any questions?

373
00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.650
>> Yes, I do. I will go back to page 5, Operation Barnacle.

374
00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:05.215
When citations or written warnings are given,

375
00:24:05.215 --> 00:24:08.965
how do you communicate that to the vessel owner?

376
00:24:08.965 --> 00:24:10.795
>> A lot of times they're certified mailed.

377
00:24:10.795 --> 00:24:12.220
If they're actually on the vessel,

378
00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:13.780
it's delivered by hand.

379
00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:15.310
Those who are not on the vessel,

380
00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:16.600
they're delivered by certified mail.

381
00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:19.810
>> But you do have access to an address because?

382
00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:23.155
>> Yes. We have identified owners of all of these vessels.

383
00:24:23.155 --> 00:24:25.810
>> With those citations or warnings,

384
00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:30.070
are there any monetary fines imposed to these folks?

385
00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:33.085
>> What happens is it goes through the state court process,

386
00:24:33.085 --> 00:24:37.795
so they will go through the court process and then that judge or Magistrate would impose

387
00:24:37.795 --> 00:24:40.570
those fines at that point keeping in

388
00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:43.540
mind that as we go through two subsequent violations,

389
00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:45.340
the first, the second, the third,

390
00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:51.265
it does require adjudication of anything other than dismissed or not guilty.

391
00:24:51.265 --> 00:24:53.650
As long as that violation is

392
00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:57.970
adjudicated with some form of guilt, that would then count towards.

393
00:24:57.970 --> 00:25:00.370
>> You're able to access all that as you move

394
00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:02.665
forward if you'd be the second or third or fourth time?

395
00:25:02.665 --> 00:25:07.315
>> Correct. Our officers have developed a very intense system of tracking these.

396
00:25:07.315 --> 00:25:08.770
I'm impressed as I go through.

397
00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:10.240
I actually went through it yesterday.

398
00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.370
Our Marine officers are very on top of this,

399
00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:13.960
very on top of the tracking.

400
00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:16.870
I've asked them specifically about where a vessel

401
00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:19.675
is in the process and they can tell me right off the pat.

402
00:25:19.675 --> 00:25:22.255
>> That's great. I do want to say thank you as well.

403
00:25:22.255 --> 00:25:24.085
This is very impressive.

404
00:25:24.085 --> 00:25:28.105
I'm pleased to see that you're on the legislature side as well.

405
00:25:28.105 --> 00:25:31.100
Great job. Thank you.

406
00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:36.400
>> Good evening, Chief. Been monitoring this for years,

407
00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.220
and I've always appreciate all the hard work you guys have put into this because I know

408
00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:44.180
it's an arduous task and get you guys out of what you need to do.

409
00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:47.155
Barnacle buses was a great idea.

410
00:25:47.155 --> 00:25:48.790
Who came up with that? That was fantastic.

411
00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:52.480
>> It was our Marine unit. [OVERLAPPING]. One in particular.

412
00:25:52.480 --> 00:26:02.875
>> Of the 9 vessels that some were cited and of the 9 that some left the area,

413
00:26:02.875 --> 00:26:04.240
and the ones that remained,

414
00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:07.930
did they clear just the propulsion system,

415
00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:09.265
or did they clear the whole haul?

416
00:26:09.265 --> 00:26:14.080
Did they haul the boat and they have a scraper go in there and clean the whole thing,

417
00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:17.320
or they just get in by with clean up the prop and the run?

418
00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:20.560
>> This was specifically tailored towards the propulsion system.

419
00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:24.505
In order to show that they rectified the problem that we cited them for,

420
00:26:24.505 --> 00:26:27.290
that was where we were focused on.

421
00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:29.515
>> Did they all look the same,

422
00:26:29.515 --> 00:26:32.035
were they all just gummed up with barnacles?

423
00:26:32.035 --> 00:26:34.885
>> A lot of them were similar to the photos they saw.

424
00:26:34.885 --> 00:26:37.030
>> Now, what about sailboats?

425
00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:40.015
Sailboats don't have to have running gear, correct,

426
00:26:40.015 --> 00:26:42.745
to make way legally in this situation?

427
00:26:42.745 --> 00:26:45.160
>> I know that they have to have that means of propulsion,

428
00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:48.295
which means that sail could act as that means of propulsion.

429
00:26:48.295 --> 00:26:50.380
To my knowledge, and Captain Banski,

430
00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:52.510
correct me if I'm wrong, none of these were sailboats.

431
00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:55.555
None of these that we're dealing with right now are sailboats.

432
00:26:55.555 --> 00:26:57.055
>> We've had sailboats in the past.

433
00:26:57.055 --> 00:27:00.680
We have the blue moon off of right inside the inlet there.

434
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:03.775
I went by that many times in my boat,

435
00:27:03.775 --> 00:27:05.980
and his rigging was derelict.

436
00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:08.260
If he put his main sail up, it would tear.

437
00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:10.675
He didn't have propulsion, but he claimed that he did.

438
00:27:10.675 --> 00:27:12.715
Do we monitor that also?

439
00:27:12.715 --> 00:27:14.530
>> We look at all the vessels that come in,

440
00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:15.910
and you'll see on the quarterly report,

441
00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:18.410
there are some sail boats on there.

442
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:22.030
I'll get with the Marine and make sure we're stand on top of those sail.

443
00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:26.605
>> I was just wondering if there's different criteria for means of propulsion, too, so.

444
00:27:26.605 --> 00:27:28.060
>> They're very vague in the statute.

445
00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:29.635
It just has to be a means of propulsion.

446
00:27:29.635 --> 00:27:31.780
If that sail works and it can push the boat.

447
00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:33.775
Again, that's a tougher one to test

448
00:27:33.775 --> 00:27:35.920
because you don't want to start it moving and then you can't stop.

449
00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.570
[LAUGHTER].

450
00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:42.295
With a 30 day if you get the license anchor for 30 days,

451
00:27:42.295 --> 00:27:45.700
but you can move anywhere within a mile,

452
00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:49.120
but it's to a different anchorage area,

453
00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:50.470
correct? Not just anywhere.

454
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:54.220
>> No. According to the ordinance that we're allowed to create,

455
00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:56.170
they have not specified that yet.

456
00:27:56.170 --> 00:27:58.600
If we were to create that ordinance,

457
00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:03.130
it tells me they're allowed to basically go anywhere in the way it reads,

458
00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:05.440
it says anywhere in the county.

459
00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.830
There's a lot of work to do left on that bill, I think.

460
00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:12.835
[OVERLAPPING]. As far as I can tell,

461
00:28:12.835 --> 00:28:15.280
an ordinance would not prevent them from moving.

462
00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.590
>> Thank you. Appreciate it for great work.

463
00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:20.815
>> Just a couple of comments. Number 1,

464
00:28:20.815 --> 00:28:23.800
this has been a strategic initiative for a number of years,

465
00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:26.800
and I think how far we've come.

466
00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:31.450
From when we first included this,

467
00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:34.120
we really didn't know how we were going to proceed on it,

468
00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:37.915
but we had environmental concerns for the Blue moon and others.

469
00:28:37.915 --> 00:28:42.560
But what strikes me here in the keep takeaways is

470
00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:49.540
the police department has done just a phenomenal job and kudos to the team,

471
00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:53.545
and I just highlight, remains proactive.

472
00:28:53.545 --> 00:29:00.250
Under emphasizes, I think how extraordinary this is because I think it's commendable.

473
00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:02.140
The one thing proactive would be,

474
00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:07.450
we've got a kittens going and you see them and you take action on them.

475
00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:11.500
But this goes beyond that to stepping it

476
00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:16.195
up significantly with the brainstorming and then doing the barnacle busters.

477
00:29:16.195 --> 00:29:22.570
Then on top of that to be continually monitoring proposed legislation.

478
00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:26.650
We already were at a high level of performance in this one,

479
00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:28.930
but I think I'd be remiss not to emphasize, really,

480
00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:35.155
this is absolutely commendable and on behalf of all of our residents in the council,

481
00:29:35.155 --> 00:29:36.985
thank you very much of the team.

482
00:29:36.985 --> 00:29:37.690
>> Thank you.

483
00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:39.920
>> Thank you, Mayor. Appreciate it.

484
00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:47.410
>> Moving on to citizen comments.

485
00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:48.700
Do we have any citizen comments?

486
00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:50.240
>> No, sir.

487
00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:54.175
>> Moving on to the minutes.

488
00:29:54.175 --> 00:29:55.480
Counsel, we have before us,

489
00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:57.640
the minutes to the November 18th meeting.

490
00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:00.760
I didn't see any corrections on the dias.

491
00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:04.840
If there are none, I'd take a motion in a second to approve the minutes as submitted.

492
00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:10.435
>> I'll make a motion that we accept the minutes of November 18, 2025 as submitted.

493
00:30:10.435 --> 00:30:11.620
>> Second.

494
00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:14.965
>> Motion and second. All in favor signify by saying aye.

495
00:30:14.965 --> 00:30:15.865
>> Aye.

496
00:30:15.865 --> 00:30:18.235
>> Motion carries unanimously.

497
00:30:18.235 --> 00:30:21.190
Moving on to the consent agenda items.

498
00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:23.530
These are items 4 through 13.

499
00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:27.505
Was there any member of the public that wished to pull a consent agenda item?

500
00:30:27.505 --> 00:30:28.630
>> No, sir.

501
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:33.430
>> Is there any member on the dias wishes to pull a consent agenda item?

502
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:35.605
>> Yes. I like to pull item number 11,

503
00:30:35.605 --> 00:30:38.500
which is resolution 130 dias 25.

504
00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.075
>> Any others?

505
00:30:40.075 --> 00:30:41.230
>> To items.

506
00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:47.080
>> I pulled number 4 and number 12.

507
00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:50.710
I'll take a motion in a second approving

508
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:57.565
the amended consent agenda consisted of items 5 through 10, and then number 13.

509
00:30:57.565 --> 00:30:58.945
>> Second.

510
00:30:58.945 --> 00:31:00.610
>> Motion is second. All in favor,

511
00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:01.975
signify by saying aye.

512
00:31:01.975 --> 00:31:03.265
>> Aye.

513
00:31:03.265 --> 00:31:06.170
>> Motion carries unanimously.

514
00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:09.850
On agenda item 4,

515
00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:11.260
this is as judicial.

516
00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:14.455
Does counsel have any ex parte disclosures?

517
00:31:14.455 --> 00:31:16.030
>> I spoke with staff.

518
00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:21.475
>> I just visited the site.

519
00:31:21.475 --> 00:31:23.870
I didn't had lunch there.

520
00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:30.355
>> I did talk with Planning and Zoning Director John Sickler,

521
00:31:30.355 --> 00:31:37.270
and I was asking for some staff suggested language that could be added to the resolution

522
00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:40.300
to prohibit future conversion of any parking spaces to

523
00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:44.590
restrict it in use to a privileged view.

524
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:46.945
Since I pulled this one,

525
00:31:46.945 --> 00:31:50.950
I pulled it and in the past,

526
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:55.555
I've had a number of conversations with Planning and Zoning.

527
00:31:55.555 --> 00:31:59.500
I see that an unintended consequence in my opinion,

528
00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.150
when you do allow a shared parking,

529
00:32:01.150 --> 00:32:03.475
which is not an entitlement,

530
00:32:03.475 --> 00:32:09.430
that sometimes the designation of spaces,

531
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:12.910
limiting them to a privileged few,

532
00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:19.030
in my opinion, has gotten out of hand in certain shopping centers.

533
00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:23.470
I know I've worked with Mr. Sickler on one of them in particular,

534
00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:27.850
and I know he's been great on following up with

535
00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:34.015
the property owner to get those what seems to be ongoing violations resolved.

536
00:32:34.015 --> 00:32:38.440
But what happens is that I think a shopping center,

537
00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:40.840
every space should be available to everybody,

538
00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:42.100
short of the handicap one.

539
00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:45.445
So when you start seeing popping up signs, it says, No,

540
00:32:45.445 --> 00:32:47.590
this is only for this person or that per,

541
00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:49.870
this business or that business,

542
00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:51.805
it is allowed by the code.

543
00:32:51.805 --> 00:32:58.855
But I've concluded that I've seen so much of this in cases that I think is wrong,

544
00:32:58.855 --> 00:33:03.100
that I'm not inclined to ever approve

545
00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:11.005
shared parking without coming back to us.

546
00:33:11.005 --> 00:33:16.555
I'd asked John to give me a suggested language,

547
00:33:16.555 --> 00:33:18.775
which she was kind enough in doing,

548
00:33:18.775 --> 00:33:21.880
and if counsel were to agree with me,

549
00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:23.710
I would just add a provision and this was

550
00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:28.630
John's suggested language that would read under parking.

551
00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:32.140
Parking spaces shall not be reserved for use by

552
00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:36.805
a specific tenant or customers of a specific tenant within the plaza.

553
00:33:36.805 --> 00:33:39.145
We're granting shared use,

554
00:33:39.145 --> 00:33:44.005
which allows them to go ahead and change the uses in the Plaza without adding parking.

555
00:33:44.005 --> 00:33:48.550
But then this Plaza cornajine and I would think it's the case.

556
00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:53.500
There is no current instances of that happening.

557
00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.330
But I just don't want it to happen.

558
00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:59.650
So one condition for me to approve it would be, adding this condition.

559
00:33:59.650 --> 00:34:02.080
I don't know if counsel agrees or disagrees,

560
00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:05.515
but if there's an agreement, I'd like to add that.

561
00:34:05.515 --> 00:34:07.915
>> Would that be Town wide or just the specific?

562
00:34:07.915 --> 00:34:10.030
>> One of these has to be done specifically.

563
00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:10.885
>> Specifically, right.

564
00:34:10.885 --> 00:34:14.110
>> When you're acting upon a site plan,

565
00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:16.135
it would be one of the conditions.

566
00:34:16.135 --> 00:34:19.820
Right now, the resolution includes a condition.

567
00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:25.990
Allowing more intensive use that could only happen with shared parking.

568
00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:27.590
That would still stand.

569
00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:29.570
But in designating this,

570
00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:34.990
there would be this provision that parking spaces

571
00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:36.670
shall not be reserved for use by

572
00:34:36.670 --> 00:34:40.295
a specific tenant or customers of a specific tenant in the Plaza.

573
00:34:40.295 --> 00:34:41.370
>> I would agree with that.

574
00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:42.610
>> I have two questions for that.

575
00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:45.570
Can I get some examples of what you mean by restricted spaces?

576
00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:50.050
Is it like loading zones or what types of restrictions qualify?

577
00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:53.490
>> Well, a couple of shopping centers in particular that I've seen,

578
00:34:53.490 --> 00:34:57.450
one that I happened to go to.

579
00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:05.530
>> Plaza name, but it's escaped me right now,

580
00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:08.185
but nonetheless, it's in Abacoa and military.

581
00:35:08.185 --> 00:35:12.370
But like one I go to,

582
00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:17.590
I see six or eight signs that are

583
00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:23.530
limiting parking to its changed over time what it was defined as,

584
00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:26.785
to 15 minutes or three minutes or something.

585
00:35:26.785 --> 00:35:28.840
I've seen the uses change.

586
00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:30.520
I look at the uses there,

587
00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:35.410
and the uses don't warrant,

588
00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:38.635
in my mind, special parking spaces, every customer,

589
00:35:38.635 --> 00:35:43.990
and so what happens is these spaces don't get used.

590
00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:46.660
They sit vacant, or alternatively,

591
00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:49.510
people who are using them, no one's going to do anything about it,

592
00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:51.025
so I'm just going to park in it.

593
00:35:51.025 --> 00:35:55.435
But they're front spots and this happens to be one of the shopping centers.

594
00:35:55.435 --> 00:35:58.930
What is the number of medical offices?

595
00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:05.440
Somebody, not with a handicap tag, likewise,

596
00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:08.680
still can't use a front spot because the sign prohibits

597
00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:12.145
that or implies you're prohibited from using it.

598
00:36:12.145 --> 00:36:14.530
>> You have the 15-minute sign or

599
00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:21.025
on the curb that stops your tires is reserved for such and such,

600
00:36:21.025 --> 00:36:24.115
like two or three outside of a specific business.

601
00:36:24.115 --> 00:36:25.840
Don't park here unless you're coming in here.

602
00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:27.010
>> We also have COVID.

603
00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:30.250
The post-COVID stuff is still around with groceries,

604
00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:33.610
and in this case,

605
00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:36.325
this is specific to this; it's not.

606
00:36:36.325 --> 00:36:37.855
>> It's only this one.

607
00:36:37.855 --> 00:36:42.145
>> But you're suggesting that this be the case always.

608
00:36:42.145 --> 00:36:43.675
>> Well, first of all,

609
00:36:43.675 --> 00:36:46.420
we don't often get a request,

610
00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:51.640
how many new projects do we have that's that big that we could have?

611
00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:54.880
It's less likely now that the towns built out.

612
00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:59.620
Those that already have shared use already have shared use and come in,

613
00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:00.730
and staff can approve it.

614
00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:02.440
I'm not talking about a code change,

615
00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:07.510
but I'm just saying if we're going to add to the inventory of

616
00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:15.430
large centers that parking areas that have to allow them to do shared use.

617
00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:18.745
I'm okay with it when I see what it's for.

618
00:37:18.745 --> 00:37:24.225
But when you're depriving residents of using spots,

619
00:37:24.225 --> 00:37:25.800
that's where I disagree.

620
00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.150
In fact, I was going by one.

621
00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:29.160
I'd rather not reference business right now,

622
00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:31.170
but the other day, I was going by,

623
00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:33.470
and I saw these two spots.

624
00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:37.720
It is in an area that there's a lot of use of the parking.

625
00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:41.560
I went over there, and I took a snap a picture of it.

626
00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:45.310
The proprietor saw me taking a picture, came out,

627
00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:50.230
and said, but I didn't want to engage in the conversation.

628
00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:51.400
I was just taking a picture,

629
00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:54.790
but it's a proprietor who says,

630
00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:58.390
Well, they have some older customers that go there,

631
00:37:58.390 --> 00:38:01.165
and they want them to have an upfront spot.

632
00:38:01.165 --> 00:38:03.910
I haven't checked with staff yet,

633
00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:05.815
but I don't believe it was approved.

634
00:38:05.815 --> 00:38:07.765
But these things just appear.

635
00:38:07.765 --> 00:38:11.170
Well, everybody would want a front spa for their customers,

636
00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:13.840
but the whole point is, it's in a shopping center, it could be,

637
00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:19.960
it should be, whoever comes should be able to use the space.

638
00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:23.020
>> This outdoor seating is a holdover from COVID?

639
00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:24.205
>> This is an outdoor seating.

640
00:38:24.205 --> 00:38:26.005
This is not an outdoor seating area here.

641
00:38:26.005 --> 00:38:31.030
In this one, they're changing the use to include it says outdoor seating in here,

642
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:35.305
but in addition, they're also changing the use,

643
00:38:35.305 --> 00:38:37.570
I think, to add more medical or something.

644
00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:42.370
I'd have to go back and look at [OVERLAPPING].

645
00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:47.050
Again, I'm okay with granting that shared parking,

646
00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:51.850
but not the unintended consequence that can happen,

647
00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:58.195
and then those are difficult to investigate and code enforcement.

648
00:38:58.195 --> 00:38:58.975
>> I agree.

649
00:38:58.975 --> 00:39:02.650
>> Just a question, Jim, sorry.

650
00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:10.480
Mayor, how would we know when a landlord has leased out

651
00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:14.530
a particular segment in a property and

652
00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:18.640
has given the tenant two spaces in front or three spaces,

653
00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:21.760
as we know some of the smaller plazas,

654
00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:27.535
so where do we cut it off from a larger parking to a smaller?

655
00:39:27.535 --> 00:39:32.530
>> First of all, if somebody has shared parking,

656
00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:36.280
approved, then staff actually does, you know,

657
00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:40.525
our planning and zoning department staff manages that.

658
00:39:40.525 --> 00:39:41.830
>>They would have to monitor.

659
00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:43.135
>> They would have to come in.

660
00:39:43.135 --> 00:39:45.400
It's not practical, really, to monitor it.

661
00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:50.950
But if it was brought to their attention and they hadn't approved it,

662
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:52.615
they can reject it,

663
00:39:52.615 --> 00:39:55.460
and then the signs have to be pulled down.

664
00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:58.330
But there are a few centers. I tell you what.

665
00:39:58.330 --> 00:40:00.430
In my mind, it's because once they

666
00:40:00.430 --> 00:40:03.025
realize it's happening and they're getting away with it,

667
00:40:03.025 --> 00:40:04.660
you start seeing a whole bunch.

668
00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:07.465
>> Sometimes they use the temporary signs also.

669
00:40:07.465 --> 00:40:10.040
>> I'm okay with that on a case-by-case basis.

670
00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:11.935
I know Abacoa is the baseball parking,

671
00:40:11.935 --> 00:40:17.620
it's all tiered, there could be use changes there in downtown. I could see a pickup.

672
00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:19.150
>> This is not downtown.

673
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:21.460
>> The one that military trail.

674
00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:22.630
>> The military rail,

675
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:25.600
but it's one that has a lot of medical uses.

676
00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.190
>> I think we've all seen that.

677
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:29.005
I think it's inconvenient.

678
00:40:29.005 --> 00:40:31.030
I'm supportive on a case-by-case basis,

679
00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:34.070
and this being one. That's fine.

680
00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:39.550
>> I'll take a motion in a second with adding this condition, please.

681
00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:41.800
>> Motion with the addition of the mayor's condition?

682
00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:42.745
>> Second.

683
00:40:42.745 --> 00:40:44.410
>> Motion a second. All in favor,

684
00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:45.865
signify by saying aye.

685
00:40:45.865 --> 00:40:47.680
>> Aye. [OVERLAPPING]

686
00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:50.180
>> Motion carries unanimously.

687
00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:54.910
Moving on to Item 11 pulled by Councilor.

688
00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:59.110
>> May I still have one more question on Number 4?

689
00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:07.390
Just a question on the lighting and when they fail, who's monitoring this?

690
00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:12.205
This sounds like, in this particular case, it's ongoing.

691
00:41:12.205 --> 00:41:15.955
Who goes around and does these inspections?

692
00:41:15.955 --> 00:41:17.965
Are they on an honor system?

693
00:41:17.965 --> 00:41:19.480
If they're on an honor system,

694
00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:22.700
the lights wouldn't be failing.

695
00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:29.470
>> For the condition, excuse me,

696
00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:32.425
John Sickler, for the record, planning and zoning.

697
00:41:32.425 --> 00:41:35.440
The owner is going to be responsible for

698
00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:38.260
maintaining records and doing monthly inspections.

699
00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:42.610
They're required to provide the town with a report annually of that,

700
00:41:42.610 --> 00:41:50.500
but we can also request or do an inspection at any time to check the purposes.

701
00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:54.670
the lights have been many lights out at that plaza.

702
00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:56.965
They have lighting, you may be familiar with,

703
00:41:56.965 --> 00:42:03.500
that outlines the perimeter edge of the coping of the building or the parapet walls.

704
00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:08.080
Excuse me, that's just been a persistent issue,

705
00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:11.125
so the Planning Commission, in particular,

706
00:42:11.125 --> 00:42:15.010
had asked that some of these issues be dealt with a little bit more deliberately,

707
00:42:15.010 --> 00:42:16.450
and that we set a standard,

708
00:42:16.450 --> 00:42:21.985
and that's when we established the more deliberate inspection process and record keeping.

709
00:42:21.985 --> 00:42:25.340
>> Makes sense. Thank you. Appreciate that.

710
00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:32.545
>> Moving on to agenda Item 11, Counsel Guisinger.

711
00:42:32.545 --> 00:42:36.175
>> I asked this jet item to be pulled.

712
00:42:36.175 --> 00:42:38.500
I'd like to make a revision to it.

713
00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:41.110
Staff worked on this revision for me the last couple of days,

714
00:42:41.110 --> 00:42:44.515
and you should have a copy of it on the dias with you.

715
00:42:44.515 --> 00:42:48.745
But primarily, it was when the presentation was made on November 6,

716
00:42:48.745 --> 00:42:52.900
part of that presentation was requesting town support for

717
00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:55.870
Jupiter Narrows Conservation Alliance efforts to name

718
00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:59.455
the Mangrove Island in Honor of Andrew Reed Harris.

719
00:42:59.455 --> 00:43:04.300
That specific statement was missing from the resolution.

720
00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:07.270
You have an amended copy here.

721
00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:11.545
I'd like to make a motion to amend that resolution as follows.

722
00:43:11.545 --> 00:43:14.980
One is really minor; we combined Paragraphs 4 and 5

723
00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:18.250
of the resolution because they are pretty much the same.

724
00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:20.890
We added the sixth paragraph or the last paragraph,

725
00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:23.590
which reads, whereas the town council, excuse me,

726
00:43:23.590 --> 00:43:27.385
the town council of the town of Jupiter supports the JCNA efforts to officially name the

727
00:43:27.385 --> 00:43:31.960
up Narrows Mango violence in honor of Andrew Reed Harris.

728
00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:34.030
>> I second.

729
00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:37.150
>> That is consistent with what I recollect.

730
00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:39.880
Thank you for getting that incorporated.

731
00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:41.350
>> Thank you to the staff for working out in

732
00:43:41.350 --> 00:43:43.075
the last couple of days and making that change for me.

733
00:43:43.075 --> 00:43:47.330
I appreciate it particularly that John Sickler was involved with it. I appreciate it.

734
00:43:49.170 --> 00:43:51.730
>> I don't remember. Did you make a motion?

735
00:43:51.730 --> 00:43:54.025
>> I made a motion and a second.

736
00:43:54.025 --> 00:43:55.780
>> Motion a second. All in favor.

737
00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:57.160
Signify by saying aye.

738
00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:58.240
>> Aye.

739
00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:01.495
>> Motion carries unanimously.

740
00:44:01.495 --> 00:44:05.740
Moving on to Item 12,

741
00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:08.050
the last item pulled from consent.

742
00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:10.790
I pulled this item.

743
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:17.890
I pulled this one, and I've had some history on this particular item here,

744
00:44:17.890 --> 00:44:26.150
but I pulled this one because I'm just concerned about allowing for one-year renewals.

745
00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:32.365
Staff went out and came back with a contract,

746
00:44:32.365 --> 00:44:34.150
and for a one-year term,

747
00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:35.320
we need to have a contract,

748
00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:37.600
so at this point in time, I'll support that,

749
00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:41.860
but I don't support the one-year renewals, the four of them.

750
00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:43.345
The reason I don't, I'll say,

751
00:44:43.345 --> 00:44:46.345
is that, in May,

752
00:44:46.345 --> 00:44:49.235
we had this bid,

753
00:44:49.235 --> 00:44:52.185
and there were six bidders.

754
00:44:52.185 --> 00:44:53.865
Now there are three.

755
00:44:53.865 --> 00:45:00.640
The apparent low bidder from that May bidding didn't submit a bid now,

756
00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:03.610
which I think was predictable to me.

757
00:45:03.610 --> 00:45:13.015
Further, the low bidder increased their bid 30% since May.

758
00:45:13.015 --> 00:45:18.415
I did talk to the staff of that 30% increase,

759
00:45:18.415 --> 00:45:21.760
13 and a half percent was due to a scope increase.

760
00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:28.010
They added an allowance for schools out camps days.

761
00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:35.550
But there was a 16.5% cost increase.

762
00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:37.740
When this was bid in May,

763
00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:43.625
the low bidder at that time was 15% lower.

764
00:45:43.625 --> 00:45:45.985
Realizing that the bids,

765
00:45:45.985 --> 00:45:51.090
we've got the number of bidders went down from 6-3,

766
00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:56.970
and the low bidder before didn't submit a bid,

767
00:45:56.970 --> 00:46:02.020
and I'm confident that with the new procurement manager that

768
00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:08.035
our reputation for seeking competitive proposals will improve.

769
00:46:08.035 --> 00:46:16.750
I want that opportunity after one year use to come back and see what what the market has.

770
00:46:16.750 --> 00:46:22.765
But again, my concern is just that this is basically

771
00:46:22.765 --> 00:46:29.515
30% higher than we had another bidder for just six months ago on, same scope basis.

772
00:46:29.515 --> 00:46:31.780
An event, so it's up to the council,

773
00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:33.805
but so I would.

774
00:46:33.805 --> 00:46:35.650
I'm supportive of the contract,

775
00:46:35.650 --> 00:46:40.300
but not making it very clear that I don't want to allow each year for us to

776
00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:45.415
do the one-year renewal because I think I'd like to see it we bid again.

777
00:46:45.415 --> 00:46:49.915
>> Is there any benefit to seeing a one-year renewal in a multi-year renewal?

778
00:46:49.915 --> 00:46:54.880
>> Well, we always put the renewal feature in there if you're satisfied,

779
00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:57.715
if you feel you have competitive pricing,

780
00:46:57.715 --> 00:46:59.440
and you're satisfied with the vendor.

781
00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:01.670
There's a cost to bid.

782
00:47:02.070 --> 00:47:06.145
>> But we're not getting any break for giving options for

783
00:47:06.145 --> 00:47:09.460
renewal on the contract? The town.

784
00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:12.820
>> Do we have the option to renew each year?

785
00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:14.245
>> We have the option.

786
00:47:14.245 --> 00:47:16.780
>> Could I actually ask staff to come up and speak to this?

787
00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:18.010
Because I know in the past, we've had

788
00:47:18.010 --> 00:47:22.270
some emergency situations with transportation for summer camp.

789
00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:24.310
There may be a benefit.

790
00:47:24.310 --> 00:47:26.710
>> Mike Haufman, Community Services.

791
00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:28.660
Good evening, Mayor, Council members.

792
00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:33.070
The idea of the one-year renewal was to actually get out of a contract in

793
00:47:33.070 --> 00:47:37.480
case they couldn't meet the standard and services of having the bus services,

794
00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:42.115
which we've had experiences with in the past so that was the idea and the intent of it,

795
00:47:42.115 --> 00:47:45.415
and I understand the mayor's concerns, but,

796
00:47:45.415 --> 00:47:48.460
if they were not able to meet those standards,

797
00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:50.990
we were able to exit the contract.

798
00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:57.820
>> I think in the past, there was a problem with meeting the standard, not just cost.

799
00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:00.025
We can get out of it.

800
00:48:00.025 --> 00:48:07.850
If we think it's a good idea to rebid for cost purposes or for performance purposes.

801
00:48:08.850 --> 00:48:11.110
>> That's a good question.

802
00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:13.930
Could it be either or cost performance?

803
00:48:13.930 --> 00:48:14.875
>> Correct.

804
00:48:14.875 --> 00:48:20.420
>> Do we have to give them a certain amount of time that it's going to be performing?

805
00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:22.930
>> It's just through one year.

806
00:48:22.930 --> 00:48:28.630
We just evaluate throughout the year.

807
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:30.070
>> What if six months in,

808
00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:32.755
they're just dropping the ball and it's not working out,

809
00:48:32.755 --> 00:48:35.575
we have the right to terminate the contract? Move on?

810
00:48:35.575 --> 00:48:39.080
>> I would need to. Yes.

811
00:48:39.690 --> 00:48:42.130
>> Bidder, my understanding,

812
00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:44.125
the bidder that's being awarded the contract,

813
00:48:44.125 --> 00:48:45.640
we've used for years,

814
00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:48.550
so it's unlikely to have performance issues.

815
00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:51.650
On a bidder you've used for years.

816
00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:58.190
It comes down to the cost.

817
00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:02.335
I'll take a motion in a second.

818
00:49:02.335 --> 00:49:05.270
However, Council wishes to do it.

819
00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:11.570
>> Well, I'll make a motion that we just accept the one-year term.

820
00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:16.675
>> Second.

821
00:49:16.675 --> 00:49:17.960
>> Second.

822
00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:20.155
>> Is that a second?

823
00:49:20.155 --> 00:49:21.940
>> Second.

824
00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:24.340
>> Any discussion?

825
00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:25.495
>> No.

826
00:49:25.495 --> 00:49:31.915
>> Take a motion, we have a motion a second to proceed with a one-year contract term.

827
00:49:31.915 --> 00:49:34.135
All in favor signify by saying aye.

828
00:49:34.135 --> 00:49:34.915
>> Aye.

829
00:49:34.915 --> 00:49:40.430
>> Any opposed? Motion carries unanimously. Thank you.

830
00:49:41.490 --> 00:49:51.320
Moving on to the regular agenda item, resolution 8625.

831
00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:56.290
This is a regular agenda item.

832
00:49:56.290 --> 00:49:58.910
I think the staff has a presentation.

833
00:50:25.850 --> 00:50:28.485
>> Good evening, Mayor and town council.

834
00:50:28.485 --> 00:50:30.525
Amanda Barnes, Director of Utilities.

835
00:50:30.525 --> 00:50:34.830
Tonight, I'll be presenting to you a contract to replace

836
00:50:34.830 --> 00:50:37.290
our existing water metering system with

837
00:50:37.290 --> 00:50:42.250
a newer technology known as advanced metering infrastructure.

838
00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:51.330
During this presentation, I will explain why this project is necessary,

839
00:50:51.330 --> 00:50:54.480
provide you a review of our existing metering system,

840
00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:57.705
an explanation of what the proposed metering system,

841
00:50:57.705 --> 00:51:01.830
how the proposed metering system will benefit the town and our customers.

842
00:51:01.830 --> 00:51:03.840
Scott Reynolds, our finance director,

843
00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:09.615
will discuss the request for proposals and the proposed funding option for the contract.

844
00:51:09.615 --> 00:51:16.000
Then I'll close in providing public education and training and key takeaways.

845
00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:24.465
The town's water system covers a service area of approximately 58 square miles,

846
00:51:24.465 --> 00:51:28.620
extending through the town's municipal boundary through the town of

847
00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:33.540
Juno Beach and into unincorporated areas of Martin and Palm Beach Counties.

848
00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:36.360
Currently, our water metering system includes

849
00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:41.430
31,243 residential and non-residential meters.

850
00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:46.380
The purpose of this project is to replace the existing water metering system that is

851
00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:50.955
at the end of its 20-year useful life with a new metering system,

852
00:51:50.955 --> 00:51:58.170
that is newer technology that will address existing metering deficiencies,

853
00:51:58.170 --> 00:52:03.105
improve operational efficiencies, and enhance customer service features.

854
00:52:03.105 --> 00:52:05.400
The proposed contract includes

855
00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:08.280
a two-year construction implementation contract with

856
00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:12.540
Core & Main to furnish and install the new metering system.

857
00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:20.640
It also includes a Software as a Service and Spectrum Lease Agreement with Sensus,

858
00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:23.340
which consists of a 10-year initial term,

859
00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:26.580
followed by an automatic 10-year renewal for

860
00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:31.440
a total 20-year contract term for the software and network lease.

861
00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:35.490
The proposed Sensus meters are warrantied for 20 years.

862
00:52:35.490 --> 00:52:39.360
As such, the supporting software and network also need to

863
00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:44.380
be in place for the 20-year life of the meters.

864
00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:54.450
Our request for proposal included the requirement for the respondents to

865
00:52:54.450 --> 00:52:59.340
include the 20-year cost for the software and

866
00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:05.160
the network subscription fees for the purpose of us to avoid

867
00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:07.980
large subscription fee increases in

868
00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:12.360
the future and also to assist with future operational budgeting.

869
00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:22.450
We do know what those subscription fees will be for the 20-year term of the contract.

870
00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:33.300
The installation of the existing metering system began in 2006.

871
00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:35.520
Next year in 2026,

872
00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:39.510
parts of the system have reached 20 years of service.

873
00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:45.735
The existing system is referred to as an automatic reading system or an AMR system.

874
00:53:45.735 --> 00:53:49.230
Customer water usage data is collected once a month by

875
00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:52.545
utility field service representatives who drive

876
00:53:52.545 --> 00:53:57.375
by the meters in vehicles equipped with mobile data receivers.

877
00:53:57.375 --> 00:54:01.200
The collected meter readings are downloaded into a database when the

878
00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:05.250
utility field representative returns to the office at the end of the day.

879
00:54:05.250 --> 00:54:08.190
Monthly meter readings are then used to generate

880
00:54:08.190 --> 00:54:11.415
the monthly water bills by customer service staff.

881
00:54:11.415 --> 00:54:14.730
Before AMR was implemented in the town,

882
00:54:14.730 --> 00:54:17.235
meters were read manually.

883
00:54:17.235 --> 00:54:20.565
Ninety-nine percent of the existing meters,

884
00:54:20.565 --> 00:54:24.450
or approximately 31,000 of the existing meters,

885
00:54:24.450 --> 00:54:26.280
are what we consider small meters.

886
00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:31.095
They're two inches in diameter and smaller,

887
00:54:31.095 --> 00:54:35.710
mostly one-inch and three-quarter-inch meters.

888
00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:42.645
Those meters are approaching at or very near to their 20-year useful life.

889
00:54:42.645 --> 00:54:49.830
The existing small meters have internal mechanical parts that wear with use,

890
00:54:49.830 --> 00:54:58.230
and nearly half of our existing small meters have failed over the past five years.

891
00:54:58.230 --> 00:55:03.615
They continue to fail at the rate of about 450-500 a month.

892
00:55:03.615 --> 00:55:07.355
Our staff has incurred overtime,

893
00:55:07.355 --> 00:55:10.925
put in extra effort during the workday to keep up with

894
00:55:10.925 --> 00:55:16.260
the failing mechanisms on the existing meters,

895
00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:22.815
and it has become a burden on staff to operate and maintain the existing system.

896
00:55:22.815 --> 00:55:28.285
Accuracy testing was conducted on a sampling of existing small meters,

897
00:55:28.285 --> 00:55:31.370
and that testing indicates that once

898
00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:34.895
the meters have been in service for more than 15 years,

899
00:55:34.895 --> 00:55:43.955
they are 7.3% less accurate than if they were less than 10-years-old.

900
00:55:43.955 --> 00:55:53.115
This translates to a missed revenue of about $1.3 million a year.

901
00:55:53.115 --> 00:55:56.550
The reduction in accuracy is a result of

902
00:55:56.550 --> 00:56:01.245
the wear of the internal components that actually measure the flow,

903
00:56:01.245 --> 00:56:09.610
so 94% of the town's small meters are greater than 10-years-old, currently.

904
00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:17.295
Only 1% or 316 of the existing meters in our system are considered large meters,

905
00:56:17.295 --> 00:56:19.425
greater than two inches in diameter.

906
00:56:19.425 --> 00:56:23.310
The majority of those are ultrasonic,

907
00:56:23.310 --> 00:56:26.040
so they do not have internal moving parts.

908
00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:32.910
There are a few older meters on fire lines that haven't been used because we haven't,

909
00:56:32.910 --> 00:56:36.510
thankfully, had any fires in those locations.

910
00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:41.190
Those would be proposed to be replaced under this contract.

911
00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:42.780
The existing large meters,

912
00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:47.940
we're proposing instead of replacing them if they're 10 years or younger

913
00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:54.165
to just retrofit their data transmitters.

914
00:56:54.165 --> 00:56:59.520
The existing AMR system has reached the end of its 20-year useful life.

915
00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:01.935
Due to the high number of register failures,

916
00:57:01.935 --> 00:57:04.350
it has become a heavy burden for staff to operate and

917
00:57:04.350 --> 00:57:09.645
maintain while also fulfilling other necessary responsibilities.

918
00:57:09.645 --> 00:57:13.785
AMR has become an outdated technology.

919
00:57:13.785 --> 00:57:16.170
The proposed metering system,

920
00:57:16.170 --> 00:57:20.145
known as advanced metering infrastructure or AMI is

921
00:57:20.145 --> 00:57:24.015
a comprehensive smart metering system that transmits near

922
00:57:24.015 --> 00:57:29.085
real-time data over a secure communications network.

923
00:57:29.085 --> 00:57:35.760
Why should we consider transitioning to AMI for our water meter reading purposes?

924
00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:37.980
In addition to resolving the failures and

925
00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:41.145
challenges that I described with the previous slide,

926
00:57:41.145 --> 00:57:42.705
as a newer technology,

927
00:57:42.705 --> 00:57:46.020
AMI will provide the town and our water customers with benefits that

928
00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:51.285
the existing system is not capable of and opportunities for future enhancements.

929
00:57:51.285 --> 00:57:53.445
AMI provides daily reads,

930
00:57:53.445 --> 00:57:55.560
enabling customer service staff to provide

931
00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:58.950
faster response and better service to customer inquiries,

932
00:57:58.950 --> 00:58:03.105
whereas the existing system only provided monthly data.

933
00:58:03.105 --> 00:58:06.825
By transmitting meter readings on a daily basis,

934
00:58:06.825 --> 00:58:09.990
AMI will also supply customers, service staff,

935
00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:15.795
and water customers with the ability to detect trends in unusually high water use,

936
00:58:15.795 --> 00:58:18.165
which can aid in early detection of leaks,

937
00:58:18.165 --> 00:58:19.470
avoiding high water bills,

938
00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:24.075
and possible costly repairs resulting from undetected leaks.

939
00:58:24.075 --> 00:58:26.460
The Sensus meters to be installed under

940
00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:29.520
the proposed contract have no internal moving parts,

941
00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:34.030
and they are guaranteed for accuracy for 20 years.

942
00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:38.250
Sensus' network and metering equipment is proven

943
00:58:38.250 --> 00:58:42.525
reliable and is in use by neighboring utilities such as Tequesta,

944
00:58:42.525 --> 00:58:44.700
Seacoast, Palm Beach County,

945
00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:49.800
Miami Dade, and many others across South Florida and the nation.

946
00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:57.030
Core & Main is able to fully transition Jupiter's water system to Sensus AMI,

947
00:58:57.030 --> 00:59:01.650
utilizing existing town infrastructure, i.e, towers.

948
00:59:01.650 --> 00:59:10.545
No new towers will need to be constructed for Sensus to convert our system to AMI,

949
00:59:10.545 --> 00:59:16.950
whereas the other respondent proposals did require additional towers to be constructed.

950
00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:24.345
Sensus also does not require the use of commercial cellular service for their system.

951
00:59:24.345 --> 00:59:30.000
They own and operate the network on which communication will occur.

952
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:34.200
The Sensus AMI system will provide the town's water customers

953
00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:38.580
with access to their daily usage through a customer portal,

954
00:59:38.580 --> 00:59:43.860
can be accessed on a computer or a smartphone application.

955
00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:46.230
Customers will be able to set thresholds for

956
00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:48.870
high bill alerts and access information to better

957
00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:54.580
understand their water use trends and control their use of water through conservation.

958
00:59:54.710 --> 00:59:58.830
Finally, AMI will provide utility field representatives with

959
00:59:58.830 --> 01:00:02.910
opportunities to perform proactive and improve system maintenance,

960
01:00:02.910 --> 01:00:04.875
which is very challenging now,

961
01:00:04.875 --> 01:00:08.250
considering the failures that we've had.

962
01:00:08.250 --> 01:00:10.695
They'll still be able to take care of

963
01:00:10.695 --> 01:00:15.000
their required customer service field tasks, meeting with residents,

964
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.915
assisting with field notifications,

965
01:00:17.915 --> 01:00:24.630
and then also providing needed support for other distribution system maintenance needs.

966
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:31.350
This slide just provides a simple illustration of how data will be transmitted over

967
01:00:31.350 --> 01:00:38.160
an AMI system where the smart meters located at the homes collect.

968
01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:43.050
There's an antenna box that will be installed next to the existing meter box.

969
01:00:43.050 --> 01:00:48.300
That antenna will transmit the data securely to existing towers,

970
01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:53.550
which will then transmit the data to the software database and customer service,

971
01:00:53.550 --> 01:00:57.550
and customers will then have access to that data.

972
01:00:59.150 --> 01:01:04.810
Scott Reynolds will now come up and present financing.

973
01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:13.090
>> Good evening. Scott Reynolds, I'm the finance director for the town of Jupiter.

974
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:20.640
We talked about this project during the budget process this summer.

975
01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:23.730
In fact, I think it was Councilor Guisinger who

976
01:01:23.730 --> 01:01:27.060
led the charge on that initially to talk about return on

977
01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:30.150
investment and those type of discussions

978
01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:34.360
surrounding the large capital investment of replacing all the meters.

979
01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:37.035
Amanda and her staff,

980
01:01:37.035 --> 01:01:38.715
they had went out to bid.

981
01:01:38.715 --> 01:01:42.690
They requested proposals and they received three proposals,

982
01:01:42.690 --> 01:01:45.990
and then were evaluated by their staff,

983
01:01:45.990 --> 01:01:49.050
and the selection committee selected and ranked

984
01:01:49.050 --> 01:01:52.980
Core & Main based on the proposal rankings.

985
01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:55.140
They went back and they negotiated,

986
01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:58.065
as Amanda and her team do,

987
01:01:58.065 --> 01:02:00.390
try to get the best price for their payers.

988
01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:03.570
They will negotiate a contract, and that's what they did.

989
01:02:03.570 --> 01:02:06.900
They went back and they negotiated a lower price based on the bid,

990
01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:09.765
savings of just over $5.5 million,

991
01:02:09.765 --> 01:02:13.860
almost $5.6 million less than what was bid.

992
01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:18.900
That was based primarily on a shorter implementation time.

993
01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:21.270
I have to give it to Amanda and her team,

994
01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:26.325
they're looking for a quick rate of return.

995
01:02:26.325 --> 01:02:29.430
This leads back to some of the discussions we had over the summer

996
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:34.350
about revenue being unrecognized or

997
01:02:34.350 --> 01:02:42.105
being lost due to the mechanics of the current legacy meters that are in the ground.

998
01:02:42.105 --> 01:02:44.310
The mechanics and the meters,

999
01:02:44.310 --> 01:02:45.630
they wear down over time.

1000
01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:48.195
They always fall in the customer's favor as far as

1001
01:02:48.195 --> 01:02:52.180
registering less revenue or less water going through the meter.

1002
01:02:57.020 --> 01:02:59.985
Get to the next slide.

1003
01:02:59.985 --> 01:03:02.985
What they've estimated is about $1.3 million

1004
01:03:02.985 --> 01:03:07.840
in unrecognized revenue annually going forward.

1005
01:03:08.270 --> 01:03:13.650
Time is of the essence to try to replace these meters with something more accurate.

1006
01:03:13.650 --> 01:03:19.230
The mechanics of the new meters that are being recommended, they're not there.

1007
01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:22.335
There is a 20-year guarantee on these meters,

1008
01:03:22.335 --> 01:03:23.760
which is very important,

1009
01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:30.120
comes into why are we requesting a 20-year contract?

1010
01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:32.700
Well, that coincides with the lifespan of

1011
01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:35.865
the meters that we're talking about placing in the ground.

1012
01:03:35.865 --> 01:03:38.625
If you can just do quick math,

1013
01:03:38.625 --> 01:03:43.155
$1.3 million over 11-year period,

1014
01:03:43.155 --> 01:03:46.770
it's already paid for what we're requesting from

1015
01:03:46.770 --> 01:03:51.030
capital investment and some operating costs of just over $14 million.

1016
01:03:51.030 --> 01:03:57.090
We will have to advance some money in the CIP to help pay for this,

1017
01:03:57.090 --> 01:04:03.600
but we've also went back and looked at carry forward dollars.

1018
01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:06.780
I know we heard that loud and clear from the council.

1019
01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:09.345
They wanted us to look for

1020
01:04:09.345 --> 01:04:13.140
sunsetting projects that were coming at the end of the fiscal year,

1021
01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:14.625
so we did some of that.

1022
01:04:14.625 --> 01:04:20.790
We got some savings of about $2.2 million in FY '25 carry-forward money to help pay for

1023
01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:23.880
this along with $3.7 million in

1024
01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:28.320
the large and small meter carry-forward dollars to help pay for it.

1025
01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:37.455
We have $14.3 million available outside of the pushing forward,

1026
01:04:37.455 --> 01:04:40.380
about 8.3 million from

1027
01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:43.140
the large and small meter future dollars that were

1028
01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:46.785
being requested to come from R&R funding.

1029
01:04:46.785 --> 01:04:50.850
But just wanted to make sure that the council

1030
01:04:50.850 --> 01:04:54.810
was aware of how we're requesting to fund this large endeavor,

1031
01:04:54.810 --> 01:04:58.455
and then also the good job by the utility staff in negotiating

1032
01:04:58.455 --> 01:05:03.780
a savings to the repayer for the implementation of the project.

1033
01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:07.050
Now, we will have to continue to spend

1034
01:05:07.050 --> 01:05:12.270
some operating dollars after the implementation every year for the 20 years.

1035
01:05:12.270 --> 01:05:13.350
But at the end of the 20 years,

1036
01:05:13.350 --> 01:05:15.315
we'll be going back out to bid again,

1037
01:05:15.315 --> 01:05:18.615
but we will have a total savings.

1038
01:05:18.615 --> 01:05:20.625
The last nine years,

1039
01:05:20.625 --> 01:05:25.305
if you still hold true of the $1.3 million in revenue reductions,

1040
01:05:25.305 --> 01:05:28.410
which that number only grows, that's today's dollars.

1041
01:05:28.410 --> 01:05:32.115
Going forward, those dollars would increase.

1042
01:05:32.115 --> 01:05:34.095
But if you just use that,

1043
01:05:34.095 --> 01:05:37.560
you're saving an additional $11.7 million on

1044
01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:42.525
those last nine years of service life of those meters.

1045
01:05:42.525 --> 01:05:44.670
With that, I'll turn it back over to Amanda,

1046
01:05:44.670 --> 01:05:48.760
unless there's some specific questions you have for me.

1047
01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:03.460
>> Thank you, Scott. The utilities and community relations Departments

1048
01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:06.730
will collaborate with Core & Main team to develop an outreach program to

1049
01:06:06.730 --> 01:06:10.510
inform and educate our water customers regarding implementation of

1050
01:06:10.510 --> 01:06:15.355
the new metering system and how it will impact them and what we need from them.

1051
01:06:15.355 --> 01:06:19.510
One of the things that will be needed from customers is for them

1052
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:23.515
to make sure that we have a three foot clear space around the meter box,

1053
01:06:23.515 --> 01:06:28.660
which that is a town standard and it's a standard in our construction,

1054
01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:31.885
guidelines and contracts right now.

1055
01:06:31.885 --> 01:06:34.315
So it's not anything new,

1056
01:06:34.315 --> 01:06:37.030
but we will be sending out notices to residents,

1057
01:06:37.030 --> 01:06:40.570
asking them to review the area around their meter box and remove

1058
01:06:40.570 --> 01:06:44.260
anything that they would like to keep if there's landscaping, they want to relocate.

1059
01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:46.510
They can go ahead and do that or any personal items.

1060
01:06:46.510 --> 01:06:48.100
They can remove those,

1061
01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:51.250
and it will also give us an opportunity

1062
01:06:51.250 --> 01:06:56.875
to meet with the resident and communicate about the project.

1063
01:06:56.875 --> 01:07:02.500
The methods that we'll use to reach residents will include mail,

1064
01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:04.015
door cards, Bill inserts,

1065
01:07:04.015 --> 01:07:06.970
the website, email blast, social media posts.

1066
01:07:06.970 --> 01:07:12.800
Then, of course, we're always available for in person meetings and phone calls.

1067
01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:22.135
Our community relations director also has experience with implementing an AMI system and

1068
01:07:22.135 --> 01:07:30.655
messaging or providing outreach communication to residents at a previous employment.

1069
01:07:30.655 --> 01:07:36.775
He's well versed in doing this and he said he's willing to help us with that.

1070
01:07:36.775 --> 01:07:40.300
Then finally, town staff will also receive training from

1071
01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:43.645
Core & Main and Census on the use of the new system.

1072
01:07:43.645 --> 01:07:49.810
Census will be responsible for operation and maintenance of the software and the network.

1073
01:07:49.810 --> 01:07:54.230
The town will not have to provide staff for that.

1074
01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:57.265
Just some key takeaways.

1075
01:07:57.265 --> 01:08:02.110
The AMI system that is proposed in the contract before you is proven technology.

1076
01:08:02.110 --> 01:08:06.740
It is successfully being utilized by neighboring utilities.

1077
01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:13.830
The town's response to customer service will be improved with this new system,

1078
01:08:13.830 --> 01:08:16.500
and customers will have access to their water use,

1079
01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:22.350
will they will be able to identify areas for water conservation and

1080
01:08:22.350 --> 01:08:29.740
also get early detection of leaks and hopefully save money in the long run,

1081
01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:33.220
not having to wait till the water bill comes to realize that they had

1082
01:08:33.220 --> 01:08:37.930
a high water bill and had a leak that caused damage that they weren't aware of.

1083
01:08:37.930 --> 01:08:43.240
The AMI system in the contract before you offers the best warranty in the industry,

1084
01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:47.425
guaranteeing metering accuracy for 20 years.

1085
01:08:47.425 --> 01:08:50.440
There are batteries with these meters.

1086
01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:53.500
The battery life is also one of the best in the industries,

1087
01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:57.835
15 years, full warranty on the batteries five year pro rated warranty.

1088
01:08:57.835 --> 01:09:03.460
The MI system propose makes use of existing town infrastructure,

1089
01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:11.140
[LAUGHTER] which is a relief to me that no new towers need to be constructed.

1090
01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:16.960
I remember what the police Department had to go through to get the tower constructed.

1091
01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:24.460
And then Core & Main is able to fully transition the town system in a two year period,

1092
01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:28.510
which would be helpful in many ways because

1093
01:09:28.510 --> 01:09:33.100
of the existing condition of the existing metering system.

1094
01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:35.920
Census also has the ability to provide

1095
01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:40.660
redundant backup networks because they do service the neighboring utilities.

1096
01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:42.670
In the event of a storm, for some reason,

1097
01:09:42.670 --> 01:09:44.755
one of our antenna towers goes out,

1098
01:09:44.755 --> 01:09:49.465
they have redundant backup to the north and to the south of us.

1099
01:09:49.465 --> 01:09:57.550
Consideration in our decision was given to retrofitting our existing system,

1100
01:09:57.550 --> 01:10:01.120
but based on the overwhelming number of failures that

1101
01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:04.555
we've had and that continue to occur,

1102
01:10:04.555 --> 01:10:13.160
the reduced accuracy of the meters that is occurring and the age of the existing system.

1103
01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:17.680
It's my opinion that it's not in our best interest to

1104
01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:21.550
retrofit or try to put a band aid on the existing system.

1105
01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:25.690
It's old technology and it should be replaced.

1106
01:10:25.690 --> 01:10:30.175
With that, I will take any questions that you might have.

1107
01:10:30.175 --> 01:10:33.115
>> Any questions? Counsel Geiger?

1108
01:10:33.115 --> 01:10:37.225
>> Yeah, I got a few. For the towers,

1109
01:10:37.225 --> 01:10:39.160
Will they get a special antenna or

1110
01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:41.575
a base station or something like that for transmitting.

1111
01:10:41.575 --> 01:10:48.100
>> Yeah. There will be antennas and base stations placed in the locations.

1112
01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:51.040
I do have representatives from Core & Main and [inaudible].

1113
01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:54.145
>> Let me start with the box in the ground first with the meter.

1114
01:10:54.145 --> 01:10:58.390
Will I have an antenna inside of it then for transmitting to a base station at Tower?

1115
01:10:58.390 --> 01:11:02.350
>> It'll look like a dome inside.

1116
01:11:02.350 --> 01:11:04.870
So we'll be putting a circular.

1117
01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:06.820
Let me go back to this slide.

1118
01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:08.740
It might be hard to see,

1119
01:11:08.740 --> 01:11:12.685
but in the picture next to the house on that slide,

1120
01:11:12.685 --> 01:11:15.925
you'll see the meter box and next to it is a circular box,

1121
01:11:15.925 --> 01:11:18.850
like an irrigation system box.

1122
01:11:18.850 --> 01:11:19.225
>> Correct.

1123
01:11:19.225 --> 01:11:22.615
>> The antenna will be located in the in that.

1124
01:11:22.615 --> 01:11:27.770
>> So that'll be above ground or will be covered by the little current water box.

1125
01:11:29.370 --> 01:11:33.460
>> It'll be set on the meter the lid.

1126
01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:34.465
>> Okay.

1127
01:11:34.465 --> 01:11:34.720
>> Yeah.

1128
01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:35.652
[inaudible]

1129
01:11:35.652 --> 01:11:46.840
[BACKGROUND]

1130
01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:47.710
>> That was my question.

1131
01:11:47.710 --> 01:11:49.460
>> State your name.

1132
01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:53.200
>> Good evening. I'm Dwyane Self.

1133
01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:58.660
I'm the regional initiative manager for Core in Maine for the AMI Smart Meter initiative.

1134
01:11:58.660 --> 01:12:01.135
Appreciate the opportunity to talk about it.

1135
01:12:01.135 --> 01:12:04.510
The antenna itself at the meter box,

1136
01:12:04.510 --> 01:12:13.840
think of it as a mushroom type looking little device that she described earlier,

1137
01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:20.350
and it's about an eighth of an inch thick as far as what would be above.

1138
01:12:20.350 --> 01:12:22.600
We can get that in

1139
01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:28.330
a recess type lid as well so that it basically sits flush with the lid. There's no

1140
01:12:28.330 --> 01:12:32.980
>> So no issue about Mowers running a [OVERLAPPING]

1141
01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:39.950
>> Not as long as they're not [OVERLAPPING] scalping I'll say scalping the yard,

1142
01:12:40.110 --> 01:12:43.120
piling up dirt with it or something like that.

1143
01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:44.680
It's generally not a problem.

1144
01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:46.390
It can be replaced as well.

1145
01:12:46.390 --> 01:12:52.075
It's a separate piece from the meter so you can replace the housing.

1146
01:12:52.075 --> 01:12:53.350
>> When I get to the tower,

1147
01:12:53.350 --> 01:12:56.410
is that like some type of just an antenna or a base station,

1148
01:12:56.410 --> 01:12:59.200
some type of equipment that gets mounted the tower.

1149
01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:03.385
>> In each tower, there is a base station that goes there.

1150
01:13:03.385 --> 01:13:05.530
It's a small box that's

1151
01:13:05.530 --> 01:13:09.190
about maybe the side a little bit smaller than a college refrigerator.

1152
01:13:09.190 --> 01:13:12.625
It's a small little box that sets

1153
01:13:12.625 --> 01:13:16.450
down low on the grounds for easy maintenance and access.

1154
01:13:16.450 --> 01:13:22.630
There's a coax cable goes up the tower or water tank or whatever we're attaching it to,

1155
01:13:22.630 --> 01:13:27.340
and we put a fiberglass standard ampinol antenna

1156
01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:29.170
similar to what cell phone companies use,

1157
01:13:29.170 --> 01:13:31.465
that kind of thing to transmit down to it.

1158
01:13:31.465 --> 01:13:33.100
>> I know you mentioned the meter,

1159
01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:37.105
but does the antenna and the base station all have the same 20 year warranty?

1160
01:13:37.105 --> 01:13:41.620
>> We're doing network as a service on this particular project,

1161
01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:43.510
which what that means is it's similar to

1162
01:13:43.510 --> 01:13:47.260
a cellular plan where the infrastructure is on me.

1163
01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:50.005
If it fails, that's not the city's problem.

1164
01:13:50.005 --> 01:13:54.235
It's my problem. We'll come in and fix the base stations and antennas and that stuff.

1165
01:13:54.235 --> 01:13:56.830
You're only concerned about

1166
01:13:56.830 --> 01:14:01.510
the radio transmitter at the house and the meter at the house,

1167
01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:04.315
and those are the 20 year warranted items.

1168
01:14:04.315 --> 01:14:08.200
>> Then the base stations covered by the annual fee repaying of

1169
01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:14.380
355825 [OVERLAPPING] Another question.

1170
01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:16.240
How long is the RNR?

1171
01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:20.005
What will take the RNR meter at a given residence?

1172
01:14:20.005 --> 01:14:24.040
RNR. Take off the existing meter and put in the.

1173
01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:27.145
I'm sorry. Remove and replace.

1174
01:14:27.145 --> 01:14:30.850
>> It depends, but it's a very short process.

1175
01:14:30.850 --> 01:14:39.670
I would say 10-15 minutes if we don't run into any random issues that will pop up.

1176
01:14:39.670 --> 01:14:42.700
Sometimes it's an access issue getting to it or

1177
01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:47.020
locating it or if we get there and discover a leak or something.

1178
01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:49.390
But in general, let's call it 10 or 15 minutes.

1179
01:14:49.390 --> 01:14:51.190
>> I'm just wondering how long the customer be with

1180
01:14:51.190 --> 01:14:54.220
disrupting the water you see so. It's very minimal.

1181
01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:57.130
>> It's very minimal we do have a process in place.

1182
01:14:57.130 --> 01:15:00.160
Typically, when we go to change out a meter, we look at it,

1183
01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:04.030
see if it's the meter that's there is currently being utilized.

1184
01:15:04.030 --> 01:15:07.510
We'll go generally knock on the door.

1185
01:15:07.510 --> 01:15:09.580
Try to make sure if there's a resident there,

1186
01:15:09.580 --> 01:15:12.265
they're aware that they're going to be out of water for some period of time.

1187
01:15:12.265 --> 01:15:17.725
For businesses, we will be contacting those businesses,

1188
01:15:17.725 --> 01:15:21.250
and a lot of times we'll do some of those after hours,

1189
01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:22.390
if it's a restaurant or something,

1190
01:15:22.390 --> 01:15:24.670
we don't want to shut them down or something like that.

1191
01:15:24.670 --> 01:15:26.790
We'll just try to pick a time

1192
01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:30.900
that they're either closed or it's a weekend that they're not open,

1193
01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:33.390
if it's a hair salon shop or something like that,

1194
01:15:33.390 --> 01:15:34.860
we'll work with those customers.

1195
01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:36.780
>> The AMI meters provided by Sensus,

1196
01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:40.400
they are ultrasonic and not electromagnetic.

1197
01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:45.175
>> They are electromagnetic on the small meters?

1198
01:15:45.175 --> 01:15:46.510
>> That's why I want to ask because they've got

1199
01:15:46.510 --> 01:15:48.820
better accuracy for the small meters, so. Okay.

1200
01:15:48.820 --> 01:15:50.240
>> Correct.

1201
01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:55.810
>> Director Barne you mentioned that customers

1202
01:15:55.810 --> 01:15:59.320
only get US mail and they want to have a scheduling conflict,

1203
01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:02.590
how can they then coordinate with the town or

1204
01:16:02.590 --> 01:16:08.190
with the supplier here a schedule for when they want to [OVERLAPPING]

1205
01:16:08.190 --> 01:16:09.945
>> You mean if they only get US mail?

1206
01:16:09.945 --> 01:16:12.120
>> Yeah. They may not get texts and [OVERLAPPING]

1207
01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:17.625
>> We will have phone numbers in the letter that for them to contact us, yes.

1208
01:16:17.625 --> 01:16:22.740
>> In my last question. I appreciate the Math you guys did as far as identifying the

1209
01:16:22.740 --> 01:16:28.385
1.3 million per year in missed revenue and also the return on investment of,

1210
01:16:28.385 --> 01:16:29.800
I think you said 11 years.

1211
01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:34.525
That's great. One question on the 1.3 million missed revenue,

1212
01:16:34.525 --> 01:16:36.130
that will now be realized.

1213
01:16:36.130 --> 01:16:38.710
That means, what is

1214
01:16:38.710 --> 01:16:42.490
the expectation to the customer relative to an increase in our water bill?

1215
01:16:42.490 --> 01:16:46.150
>> I did look into that this afternoon.

1216
01:16:46.150 --> 01:16:53.715
Our average user is a 10,000 gallon a month consumption use.

1217
01:16:53.715 --> 01:17:03.550
Applying the 7.3% increase that we expect to see in accuracy,

1218
01:17:03.550 --> 01:17:06.940
and based on our current water rates,

1219
01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:13.240
I calculated $2.08 a month increase. Maybe.

1220
01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:20.230
>> Yeah. I looked at the 1.3 by across the 31,000 meters like $41 a year,

1221
01:17:20.230 --> 01:17:23.485
so that seems more realistic based on the usage. I appreciate.

1222
01:17:23.485 --> 01:17:25.930
>> It depends how large of a consumer.

1223
01:17:25.930 --> 01:17:29.365
We're in a conservation based rate structure.

1224
01:17:29.365 --> 01:17:31.945
The more water you use, the higher the rate is.

1225
01:17:31.945 --> 01:17:36.130
It could encourage conservation for sure.

1226
01:17:36.130 --> 01:17:38.500
>> There's an app that the homeowner will have.

1227
01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:39.850
He can look at his water usage,

1228
01:17:39.850 --> 01:17:42.340
look what time of day is the most used

1229
01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:46.610
and a little more conservative like to be conservation.

1230
01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:50.860
Thank you. Appreciate it. I have no other questions.

1231
01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:53.110
>> Thank you. One question I have is,

1232
01:17:53.110 --> 01:17:55.780
is there two way communication with the system,

1233
01:17:55.780 --> 01:18:01.075
which means is there a mechanism by which you can control or shut on or off the water?

1234
01:18:01.075 --> 01:18:05.965
>> There are meters that I think they're called ally.

1235
01:18:05.965 --> 01:18:10.930
The ally meters do have a feature that would

1236
01:18:10.930 --> 01:18:15.370
allow us to remotely turn on and turn off the meters.

1237
01:18:15.370 --> 01:18:23.590
Right now we're not recommending a full installation of those meters.

1238
01:18:23.590 --> 01:18:26.020
They are a higher dollar meter.

1239
01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:33.520
But we may strategically place them in areas in the system.

1240
01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:36.310
I haven't personally looked at that closely.

1241
01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:40.525
Jonathan has been managing this project and I know he has.

1242
01:18:40.525 --> 01:18:46.240
I believe we do plan on strategically placing some of those meters in certain locations.

1243
01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:49.720
But we won't do a full sale instalIation of them.

1244
01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:53.080
>> We don't need to. I understand if it did exist.

1245
01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:56.140
I saw that our water Master plan a couple of years ago.

1246
01:18:56.140 --> 01:19:00.970
My other question was related to what Counselor Geiger spoke with,

1247
01:19:00.970 --> 01:19:03.250
which is, our accuracy will improve,

1248
01:19:03.250 --> 01:19:04.630
but to a customer.

1249
01:19:04.630 --> 01:19:06.550
They'll just see their bill increase.

1250
01:19:06.550 --> 01:19:10.510
I just want to make sure that we're aware of the communication plan.

1251
01:19:10.510 --> 01:19:13.120
I'm glad to see that there is one.

1252
01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:18.235
Then the 20 year period struck me as long for technology,

1253
01:19:18.235 --> 01:19:21.820
especially a technology software item in particular.

1254
01:19:21.820 --> 01:19:24.400
Twenty year agreements, you say these other utilities

1255
01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:27.010
have 20 year agreements, is that right?

1256
01:19:27.010 --> 01:19:31.945
>> It's standard. Our current system has a 20 year.

1257
01:19:31.945 --> 01:19:34.045
I wouldn't call it an agreement because we didn't really have

1258
01:19:34.045 --> 01:19:36.955
a contract like we are for this one,

1259
01:19:36.955 --> 01:19:40.435
which is why I wanted to have a contract in place.

1260
01:19:40.435 --> 01:19:48.325
But it is normal for metering systems to have a useful life of 20 years.

1261
01:19:48.325 --> 01:19:50.560
Some of them make it 20 years,

1262
01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:52.580
some of them don't.

1263
01:19:54.270 --> 01:19:56.125
>> Thank you.

1264
01:19:56.125 --> 01:19:57.580
>> Some of my questions are answered,

1265
01:19:57.580 --> 01:19:59.350
the 20 year contract.

1266
01:19:59.350 --> 01:20:01.630
I've never seen a 20 year contract since I've been up here,

1267
01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:04.825
but I understand the reasoning behind it.

1268
01:20:04.825 --> 01:20:07.330
Are these what they call smart meters?

1269
01:20:07.330 --> 01:20:08.080
>> Smart meters.

1270
01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:11.665
>> Yeah. I know there was in the past,

1271
01:20:11.665 --> 01:20:13.090
when Smart Meters first came out,

1272
01:20:13.090 --> 01:20:17.080
people were afraid the utility could just shut your water off

1273
01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:23.260
or but you said you're going to place those somewhat strategically in the town?

1274
01:20:23.260 --> 01:20:26.830
>> Yeah. If we need to,

1275
01:20:26.830 --> 01:20:28.630
we will place them strategically,

1276
01:20:28.630 --> 01:20:30.505
we would never shut somebody off without

1277
01:20:30.505 --> 01:20:33.790
notifying them or for the proper notice and all that.[LAUGHTER]

1278
01:20:33.790 --> 01:20:38.330
>> I still needs to be manually in the box with the wrench and all that.

1279
01:20:39.090 --> 01:20:42.010
In regards to to the antenna,

1280
01:20:42.010 --> 01:20:43.285
what about land debris,

1281
01:20:43.285 --> 01:20:47.395
dirt getting on that dome and messing with the signal?

1282
01:20:47.395 --> 01:20:50.125
>> I have one at my house.

1283
01:20:50.125 --> 01:20:53.300
I've never had a problem with it.

1284
01:20:53.790 --> 01:20:58.555
It's in an area that's underneath an oak tree?

1285
01:20:58.555 --> 01:21:00.760
We've not had any problem.

1286
01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:06.025
Unless it gets covered in dirt, like buried.

1287
01:21:06.025 --> 01:21:08.245
I don't see that there would be a problem.

1288
01:21:08.245 --> 01:21:11.065
>> It sits outside the box.

1289
01:21:11.065 --> 01:21:14.510
>> It's in the lid of the box.

1290
01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:17.230
>> Some of the mowers are riders and they're heavy

1291
01:21:17.230 --> 01:21:19.510
so that they're durable and all that doesn't,

1292
01:21:19.510 --> 01:21:22.405
how often do they get damaged, usually?

1293
01:21:22.405 --> 01:21:24.860
Is there a percentage on that or

1294
01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:29.240
Sure.

1295
01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:31.250
The actual mushroom cap itself,

1296
01:21:31.250 --> 01:21:32.990
I'm not worried about somebody driving over it.

1297
01:21:32.990 --> 01:21:35.525
In fact, they are, call it light traffic rated,

1298
01:21:35.525 --> 01:21:39.905
got them placed in driveways and people can drive cars over them and that stuff.

1299
01:21:39.905 --> 01:21:44.015
As far as how frequently they're damaged,

1300
01:21:44.015 --> 01:21:47.525
it's not a every day thing. It does happen.

1301
01:21:47.525 --> 01:21:50.600
I would say the two most common causes I see with

1302
01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:53.990
damage is people burning lawn leaves and stuff in the fall,

1303
01:21:53.990 --> 01:21:58.460
and for some reason, they decide to burn it over the top of meter box and melt it down.

1304
01:21:58.460 --> 01:22:02.840
Occasionally, we do have some that get hit by a lawn mower.

1305
01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:05.285
Usually that's an education process.

1306
01:22:05.285 --> 01:22:09.110
If you're mowing your grass at the millimeters,

1307
01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:10.160
that thing, scalping it,

1308
01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:11.990
it's really not good for the lawn anyway.

1309
01:22:11.990 --> 01:22:15.560
But the other side of it is just making sure

1310
01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:20.150
that if the box sets a little bit high in the yard,

1311
01:22:20.150 --> 01:22:23.240
we lower it down and work with the home.

1312
01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:26.555
Main concern is a lot of people have just lawn maintenance services,

1313
01:22:26.555 --> 01:22:28.610
and these guys come in with the riding mowers and they're

1314
01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:31.025
just running around, they don't care what they hit.

1315
01:22:31.025 --> 01:22:32.750
They're trying to get the job in quickly,

1316
01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:35.180
so things need to be flushed to the ground

1317
01:22:35.180 --> 01:22:39.155
and even lower than a scalping more like a homeowner we do.

1318
01:22:39.155 --> 01:22:43.430
I said, we've got many systems in the surrounding area.

1319
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:49.520
We did almost 200,000 of these in Palm Beach County and it happens,

1320
01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:53.405
but it's not a common everyday occurring.

1321
01:22:53.405 --> 01:22:58.160
Just don't think it happens. A lot of times unless they really get deep with the damage,

1322
01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:00.470
you can replace the housing and you're just fine,

1323
01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:05.600
long as you don't Breach the housing where moisture can get into the electronics.

1324
01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:07.850
I imagined I'm not a meter expert.

1325
01:23:07.850 --> 01:23:11.450
The old meters probably had some impeller inside than when the water and through

1326
01:23:11.450 --> 01:23:16.070
it spun spinning device, let's that.

1327
01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:18.270
How do these work?

1328
01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:22.940
This is what they call an electromagnetic magneter,

1329
01:23:22.940 --> 01:23:25.655
and essentially, it places a charge,

1330
01:23:25.655 --> 01:23:30.755
let's call it a very low voltage field of energy,

1331
01:23:30.755 --> 01:23:33.245
if you want to call it that and what it's looking for

1332
01:23:33.245 --> 01:23:37.115
is as water has some type of mineral in it.

1333
01:23:37.115 --> 01:23:38.150
Let's call it iron,

1334
01:23:38.150 --> 01:23:42.875
calcium, some particulate,

1335
01:23:42.875 --> 01:23:46.355
and it knows how much water is in the pipe,

1336
01:23:46.355 --> 01:23:49.295
and it measures the speed of what things

1337
01:23:49.295 --> 01:23:52.610
are going past the sensors that are in the meter,

1338
01:23:52.610 --> 01:23:54.995
so it's able to deduce very accurately.

1339
01:23:54.995 --> 01:23:56.675
It's not a new technology.

1340
01:23:56.675 --> 01:23:59.720
Magmeter technology has been around since the 1800s.

1341
01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:02.720
It knows the volume and it's just reading the speed and calculating.

1342
01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:03.140
Correct.

1343
01:24:03.140 --> 01:24:05.060
Volume. Interesting.

1344
01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:08.980
It's very old, very reliable.

1345
01:24:08.980 --> 01:24:10.660
Typically in the past,

1346
01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:12.835
you had to have electricity to make it work.

1347
01:24:12.835 --> 01:24:15.730
Evolution of battery technology is what's all evolved

1348
01:24:15.730 --> 01:24:19.135
this into being able to do this in a residential application.

1349
01:24:19.135 --> 01:24:25.325
Is a lithium battery inside or solar or how does it work?

1350
01:24:25.325 --> 01:24:28.340
It's a lithium type of battery.

1351
01:24:28.340 --> 01:24:33.005
It's a very long range type of battery technology that census has.

1352
01:24:33.005 --> 01:24:34.700
We've had very good results.

1353
01:24:34.700 --> 01:24:42.650
We sold our first Flex system Florida in 2007 in Apopka and they're still ticking along.

1354
01:24:42.650 --> 01:24:44.810
Been doing this 20 years now and some of

1355
01:24:44.810 --> 01:24:47.555
the earlier systems that I sold are still up and running.

1356
01:24:47.555 --> 01:24:49.220
It must be a super low voltage.

1357
01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:54.590
Very low voltage and it also uses capacitors so it's not like a constant on,

1358
01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:59.030
I just is a slow drain on the battery a constant poll.

1359
01:24:59.030 --> 01:25:03.140
Got you. I think that's it. Thank you. Appreciate it.

1360
01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:03.980
Thank you.

1361
01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:07.400
Thank you. Director Amander and your staff done a great job.

1362
01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:08.990
A lot of my questions have been answered,

1363
01:25:08.990 --> 01:25:12.110
but I want to go back to your comment earlier

1364
01:25:12.110 --> 01:25:16.100
about approximately 450 to 500

1365
01:25:16.100 --> 01:25:20.180
right now failures that staff have to go out and make repairs.

1366
01:25:20.180 --> 01:25:20.915
Yes.

1367
01:25:20.915 --> 01:25:24.560
Staff a lot of time and revenue.

1368
01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:26.315
It cost a lot of money to go out there.

1369
01:25:26.315 --> 01:25:28.175
What are we going to be saving when?

1370
01:25:28.175 --> 01:25:29.750
Once this is all done,

1371
01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:32.795
and we don't have that issue anymore.

1372
01:25:32.795 --> 01:25:38.900
That's a cost savings by itself so in 2025,

1373
01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:44.090
we estimated just on staff time to address the failed registers.

1374
01:25:44.090 --> 01:25:48.830
We probably spent about $110,000 in staff time.

1375
01:25:48.830 --> 01:25:50.600
Some of that was overtime.

1376
01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:52.370
Some of that was during the regular.

1377
01:25:52.370 --> 01:26:00.350
[OVERLAPPING] It basically took staff away from doing other duties.

1378
01:26:00.350 --> 01:26:02.225
That what they have.

1379
01:26:02.225 --> 01:26:04.340
On that 20 year contract,

1380
01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:10.145
it's just to correlate with the life of the product itself and the meters.

1381
01:26:10.145 --> 01:26:14.150
The antenna, I was very glad you got clarification on that because I

1382
01:26:14.150 --> 01:26:18.455
was trying to figure out how it was not going to get damaged.

1383
01:26:18.455 --> 01:26:22.160
The battery life, and you've mentioned,

1384
01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:23.495
I think it was a Popca,

1385
01:26:23.495 --> 01:26:26.660
a 2007, and they're still going strong.

1386
01:26:26.660 --> 01:26:32.420
When the batteries do fail at whatever point it might be and maybe never,

1387
01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:38.360
how do you not how does that work that you know the batteries died?

1388
01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:41.450
If we won't be able to get we won't get a read back.

1389
01:26:41.450 --> 01:26:43.370
I'm sure the system would probably allow.

1390
01:26:43.370 --> 01:26:46.280
I didn't know the system had a way of communicating that back.

1391
01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:52.070
The good thing about the small meters is if the battery fails,

1392
01:26:52.070 --> 01:26:54.665
which means the register fail,

1393
01:26:54.665 --> 01:26:57.845
we can get a manual reading on it as well,

1394
01:26:57.845 --> 01:27:02.190
which we cannot do right now with many of our existing meters.

1395
01:27:02.740 --> 01:27:06.740
I was just going to say it does have a low battery alarm.

1396
01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:10.625
It takes every time it sends a transmission packet of data,

1397
01:27:10.625 --> 01:27:12.230
and it's not just the meter read,

1398
01:27:12.230 --> 01:27:15.320
it actually sends a packet of data.

1399
01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:19.295
One of the items that's in the packet is a battery voltage.

1400
01:27:19.295 --> 01:27:23.000
It keeps track of the battery voltage on the battery itself in the transmitter,

1401
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.680
and when it starts detecting

1402
01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:27.890
a certain threshold where some will call it a low battery alarm,

1403
01:27:27.890 --> 01:27:31.040
which is usually about six months of life left in the battery,

1404
01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:32.630
it'll flag and say,

1405
01:27:32.630 --> 01:27:33.950
I've got a low battery.

1406
01:27:33.950 --> 01:27:41.765
That gives you an opportunity to go out and do some proactive maintenance type processes.

1407
01:27:41.765 --> 01:27:48.020
The other side, you did mention it as well is there is a transmitter in the field,

1408
01:27:48.020 --> 01:27:49.835
there is a meter in the field,

1409
01:27:49.835 --> 01:27:51.725
that's a separate device.

1410
01:27:51.725 --> 01:27:54.170
If the transmitter fails,

1411
01:27:54.170 --> 01:27:57.365
you can go out and get the reading off of the meter.

1412
01:27:57.365 --> 01:27:58.850
If the meter fails,

1413
01:27:58.850 --> 01:28:06.170
because it's pulling the data up from the meter on an hourly basis,

1414
01:28:06.170 --> 01:28:08.285
you can go and get the transmitter data

1415
01:28:08.285 --> 01:28:10.595
up until the point of failure of the meter itself.

1416
01:28:10.595 --> 01:28:12.500
The data doesn't disappear.

1417
01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:14.675
It's stored in two different locations.

1418
01:28:14.675 --> 01:28:18.995
The resident would never really even know this was happened,

1419
01:28:18.995 --> 01:28:22.370
you're going to get the notice first through your data supply?

1420
01:28:22.370 --> 01:28:23.675
Yes.

1421
01:28:23.675 --> 01:28:26.750
The last question and you talked about it,

1422
01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:30.900
the small increase that the resident will have on a monthly basis.

1423
01:28:30.970 --> 01:28:35.750
Communication, you've been very succinct on how we're going to get it out there.

1424
01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:40.160
I think that's real important because they can relate to smart technology,

1425
01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:45.815
new technology, and to the accuracy will be there for them to control.

1426
01:28:45.815 --> 01:28:48.065
I think that's a real highlight of this product.

1427
01:28:48.065 --> 01:28:49.325
Thank you for your hard work.

1428
01:28:49.325 --> 01:28:50.760
You're welcome.

1429
01:28:52.420 --> 01:28:56.615
Any more questions. Seeing no,

1430
01:28:56.615 --> 01:28:58.715
I'll take a motion in a second.

1431
01:28:58.715 --> 01:29:00.605
I'll make a motion to approve.

1432
01:29:00.605 --> 01:29:01.895
Second.

1433
01:29:01.895 --> 01:29:05.840
Just for discussion. I didn't have any questions to ask,

1434
01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:12.875
but I cannot support the contract award so first of all, let me make it clear.

1435
01:29:12.875 --> 01:29:16.025
I have no issue with regard to the need for the project.

1436
01:29:16.025 --> 01:29:23.990
I have no issue with regard to recommended contractor equipment or services.

1437
01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:26.285
I support of that.

1438
01:29:26.285 --> 01:29:28.700
I can't support the contract award on the basis of

1439
01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:32.390
my longstanding differences of opinions about the War of utilities,

1440
01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:38.040
procurement, fiscal management and contract negotiation practices.

1441
01:29:38.350 --> 01:29:41.120
Sum rate key takeaways.

1442
01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:43.310
Calling main was deemed by

1443
01:29:43.310 --> 01:29:47.210
the water utility staff to be the most qualified and therefore,

1444
01:29:47.210 --> 01:29:50.060
it's top rate for the project.

1445
01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:54.110
I may even agree that they were the most qualified.

1446
01:29:54.110 --> 01:30:00.080
But their net based bid prices were 4.7000003 million

1447
01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:03.050
higher than a little bitter for the width

1448
01:30:03.050 --> 01:30:06.545
versus without optional equipment scenarios respectively.

1449
01:30:06.545 --> 01:30:07.730
It's a big cost difference.

1450
01:30:07.730 --> 01:30:11.760
I would have liked to have seen that be pursued further.

1451
01:30:11.860 --> 01:30:17.225
The claim contract negotiation with CNM,

1452
01:30:17.225 --> 01:30:23.660
staff top rank firm result in scope of work and associated cost reductions.

1453
01:30:23.660 --> 01:30:27.080
That was the millions of dollars so it's always the case when

1454
01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:31.320
you talk about if you can reduce costs.

1455
01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:36.470
That could well have been the case with the apparent little bidder.

1456
01:30:36.470 --> 01:30:41.195
However, we don't have that information because of the town's procurement practices of

1457
01:30:41.195 --> 01:30:46.355
negotiating with its preferred supplier.

1458
01:30:46.355 --> 01:30:54.875
The claim financial benefits for water meter accuracy improvements,

1459
01:30:54.875 --> 01:31:02.165
estimated at 1.3 million per year from, increased water revenues.

1460
01:31:02.165 --> 01:31:04.865
Let me say this clearly.

1461
01:31:04.865 --> 01:31:08.105
From a water utility customer perspective,

1462
01:31:08.105 --> 01:31:11.645
and also mine is elected official.

1463
01:31:11.645 --> 01:31:17.480
This would actually represent a water rate hike and not a financial benefit to them.

1464
01:31:17.480 --> 01:31:21.620
Net evaluations and spending decisions should always

1465
01:31:21.620 --> 01:31:25.430
be performed on a net customer benefit basis.

1466
01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:29.600
Historically, we knew we've always known that

1467
01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:33.890
meters over the course of time work in the favor of the customer.

1468
01:31:33.890 --> 01:31:35.955
But that's built into our system.

1469
01:31:35.955 --> 01:31:39.730
I don't think anybody will be surprised on the diets that the

1470
01:31:39.730 --> 01:31:43.915
next time somebody comes and asks for an annual increase.

1471
01:31:43.915 --> 01:31:46.770
I'm going to ponder about gee,

1472
01:31:46.770 --> 01:31:50.510
already got their increase because we're so more to consumption.

1473
01:31:50.510 --> 01:31:53.585
We're now saying it's higher and it is, I get it.

1474
01:31:53.585 --> 01:31:55.325
But the point is,

1475
01:31:55.325 --> 01:31:57.620
I just evaluate things differently.

1476
01:31:57.620 --> 01:32:01.320
You should always look from the customer benefit basis.

1477
01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:06.740
The expedited implementation schedule for a full conversion from

1478
01:32:06.740 --> 01:32:12.320
five years to two years reportedly resulted in $1 million savings.

1479
01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:15.440
The implementation schedule change will effectively

1480
01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:21.350
consume a net 1.5 years of a new meters useful life.

1481
01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:24.560
This should have been taken into account in the project decision,

1482
01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:27.750
evaluation as I've long advocated.

1483
01:32:30.430 --> 01:32:33.545
We could have managed in my opinion,

1484
01:32:33.545 --> 01:32:37.400
the fact that I think the existing meters were

1485
01:32:37.400 --> 01:32:43.190
replaced over a much longer schedule basis period.

1486
01:32:43.190 --> 01:32:45.200
I think it might have been as much as ten years,

1487
01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:48.350
but it's not worth asking the question whether it was seven,

1488
01:32:48.350 --> 01:32:50.540
ten, I was over many years.

1489
01:32:50.540 --> 01:32:55.160
It would be predictable to me that the oldest ones would be the ones you'd be

1490
01:32:55.160 --> 01:33:01.265
replacing so you don't have to do 100% of them to really knock that number down.

1491
01:33:01.265 --> 01:33:04.340
I believe you should be able to tell based on how long they're in there

1492
01:33:04.340 --> 01:33:08.465
so I would have that's the way in my former day job,

1493
01:33:08.465 --> 01:33:11.915
how we would have managed the project differently.

1494
01:33:11.915 --> 01:33:15.500
Then the annual software lease agreement,

1495
01:33:15.500 --> 01:33:18.185
cost increases were 3% a year,

1496
01:33:18.185 --> 01:33:22.190
which exceeds the historical 20 year inflationary rate.

1497
01:33:22.190 --> 01:33:28.460
I think this should have been negotiated for annual increases at CPI or less.

1498
01:33:28.460 --> 01:33:31.280
With an not to exceed annual cap.

1499
01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:33.710
That's the business storm I'm familiar with.

1500
01:33:33.710 --> 01:33:37.040
I tell you, I'm sure we all feel the same way.

1501
01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:45.350
A lot of these projects when they have a ongoing future cost that is going to exceed CPI,

1502
01:33:45.350 --> 01:33:49.685
I wonder how we're going to cover that cost in the future.

1503
01:33:49.685 --> 01:33:52.385
These are just issues.

1504
01:33:52.385 --> 01:33:55.295
I've said everything here before.

1505
01:33:55.295 --> 01:33:59.555
I just have different approach to how this would have been done.

1506
01:33:59.555 --> 01:34:01.805
Whether it came out with a different outcome.

1507
01:34:01.805 --> 01:34:06.020
I know the evaluation would be claiming benefits that are claimed here,

1508
01:34:06.020 --> 01:34:08.600
but we'll never know so with that,

1509
01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:11.360
we have a motion in a second.All in favor,

1510
01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:12.770
signify by saying aye.

1511
01:34:12.770 --> 01:34:14.555
I just want to quickly say something.

1512
01:34:14.555 --> 01:34:17.120
I do want to say that to the customer,

1513
01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:18.575
there is also a benefit.

1514
01:34:18.575 --> 01:34:20.810
I think it is more complex and nuanced,

1515
01:34:20.810 --> 01:34:23.345
as Councilor Guisinger said.

1516
01:34:23.345 --> 01:34:26.975
With the cost, which I think we're all concerned about,

1517
01:34:26.975 --> 01:34:28.910
I think the resident will see it.

1518
01:34:28.910 --> 01:34:30.275
As an increase.

1519
01:34:30.275 --> 01:34:31.820
Granted a $2 increase,

1520
01:34:31.820 --> 01:34:33.935
but I think we're sensitive to that.

1521
01:34:33.935 --> 01:34:36.440
But there's also an increased level of service.

1522
01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:39.455
I think understanding and being able to track daily use,

1523
01:34:39.455 --> 01:34:44.780
all the information at our fingertap tips that we've never had before on a daily basis.

1524
01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:48.950
The ability to better conserve water and resources town wide,

1525
01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:50.630
I think is really valuable.

1526
01:34:50.630 --> 01:34:52.685
I just want to share that,

1527
01:34:52.685 --> 01:34:56.810
I think that it's very nuanced and complex,

1528
01:34:56.810 --> 01:35:00.770
and I think there are some of this is not ideal.

1529
01:35:00.770 --> 01:35:03.125
The rates of failure that we're dealing with,

1530
01:35:03.125 --> 01:35:05.825
we need to do this and get it done.

1531
01:35:05.825 --> 01:35:08.690
But there's some real good in

1532
01:35:08.690 --> 01:35:11.990
this technology and I know that we have been talking about it,

1533
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:14.510
at least since I joined Council in 2022.

1534
01:35:14.510 --> 01:35:16.820
I want to say thank you for the work that you've done.

1535
01:35:16.820 --> 01:35:20.280
I know that this is a big project.

1536
01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:23.990
The utility is also an enterprise fund,

1537
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:29.300
and it's quasi run like a business where so you're

1538
01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:32.360
distributing your product and you're not being compensated

1539
01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:36.155
efficiently so I think you need to get everything up to speed.

1540
01:35:36.155 --> 01:35:38.180
That's built in the race.

1541
01:35:38.180 --> 01:35:40.250
They want to debate and by the way,

1542
01:35:40.250 --> 01:35:41.930
I know there's other benefits.

1543
01:35:41.930 --> 01:35:46.655
I'm going based on the way it was presented here was I'm just used to

1544
01:35:46.655 --> 01:35:49.865
a much different totality of evaluation

1545
01:35:49.865 --> 01:35:53.900
where those benefits could have been taken account.

1546
01:35:53.900 --> 01:35:57.965
We had a we water leak in my house that wasn't caught by the

1547
01:35:57.965 --> 01:36:02.420
original I was stunned that the utility never called me to tell me,

1548
01:36:02.420 --> 01:36:04.535
but they didn't have that capability.

1549
01:36:04.535 --> 01:36:08.780
There can be you better believe I got a significant water bill.

1550
01:36:08.780 --> 01:36:10.680
It of people had.

1551
01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:15.230
Particularly in heavy tree area neighborhoods.

1552
01:36:15.230 --> 01:36:16.385
I understand all that,

1553
01:36:16.385 --> 01:36:20.945
but I think the points I made were valid and I just would like to going four someday.

1554
01:36:20.945 --> 01:36:26.165
For these thing, the evaluations be done differently and taking this into account,

1555
01:36:26.165 --> 01:36:28.070
then I'd be more comfortable about it.

1556
01:36:28.070 --> 01:36:30.320
With that, we have a motion to second all in favor,

1557
01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:31.670
signify by saying aye.

1558
01:36:31.670 --> 01:36:32.935
Aye.

1559
01:36:32.935 --> 01:36:39.580
>> Posed made, the motion carries 4:1 with Mayor Kuretski to start off.

1560
01:36:39.770 --> 01:36:44.865
Moving on to Resolution 120-25,

1561
01:36:44.865 --> 01:36:52.350
approving contracts to four contractors for general contracting continuing services,

1562
01:36:52.350 --> 01:36:55.330
turn it over to staff.

1563
01:37:05.300 --> 01:37:07.755
>> Good evening, Mayor, Council.

1564
01:37:07.755 --> 01:37:09.315
For the record, George Dzama,

1565
01:37:09.315 --> 01:37:12.625
the Director of Engineering and Public Works.

1566
01:37:12.625 --> 01:37:17.720
Please to request Town Council's approval of Resolution 120-25 in

1567
01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:22.665
the Award of four Continuing Services Contracts to Catchment Construction,

1568
01:37:22.665 --> 01:37:25.425
RCAS LLC, Proctor Construction,

1569
01:37:25.425 --> 01:37:28.710
and Fierce Construction for General Contracting,

1570
01:37:28.710 --> 01:37:32.220
and a combined amount not to exceed $6 million

1571
01:37:32.220 --> 01:37:37.605
for a three-year term with two optional one-year renewal terms.

1572
01:37:37.605 --> 01:37:44.385
This is a versatile contract that is intended to be utilized by multiple departments,

1573
01:37:44.385 --> 01:37:48.045
in addition to engineering and public works.

1574
01:37:48.045 --> 01:37:51.690
There's parks, utilities, planning and zoning.

1575
01:37:51.690 --> 01:37:55.650
All departments that are responsible for facilities.

1576
01:37:55.650 --> 01:38:00.000
The contract scope is outlined in the executive summary.

1577
01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:05.355
Some of the highlights are the building and facility site work.

1578
01:38:05.355 --> 01:38:07.020
We have building construction,

1579
01:38:07.020 --> 01:38:10.155
including structural, mechanical, electrical,

1580
01:38:10.155 --> 01:38:14.295
plumbing, building roofing, building envelope,

1581
01:38:14.295 --> 01:38:18.645
and weather protection, and site monument construction.

1582
01:38:18.645 --> 01:38:23.130
The contracts will be used for budgeted projects,

1583
01:38:23.130 --> 01:38:25.425
unless otherwise approved by the council.

1584
01:38:25.425 --> 01:38:29.730
Projects will be assigned via work order based on availability of funds,

1585
01:38:29.730 --> 01:38:33.720
project costs, and availability to meet project schedules.

1586
01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:37.620
In addition, projects will be based on price,

1587
01:38:37.620 --> 01:38:41.280
responsiveness, and quality of workmanship.

1588
01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:46.005
Most project assignments will have a value of less than 300,000.

1589
01:38:46.005 --> 01:38:50.145
There were some projects,

1590
01:38:50.145 --> 01:38:56.010
higher-scale projects that were included in the bid that are attached,

1591
01:38:56.010 --> 01:39:00.690
which are included in the fiscal year 2026,

1592
01:39:00.690 --> 01:39:04.845
CIP, and operating and maintenance budgets.

1593
01:39:04.845 --> 01:39:09.510
Most of those projects are park facility projects as well

1594
01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:15.460
as a few public works and utility storage building projects.

1595
01:39:15.740 --> 01:39:21.750
The intent of this contract is much like

1596
01:39:21.750 --> 01:39:27.825
the resurfacing contract that was awarded at the last council meeting.

1597
01:39:27.825 --> 01:39:31.980
However, this is strictly for buildings and facilities,

1598
01:39:31.980 --> 01:39:36.210
and the procurement process was a request for proposal in which

1599
01:39:36.210 --> 01:39:41.565
the contractors were selected based on prices,

1600
01:39:41.565 --> 01:39:46.665
qualifications, and an understanding of the contract intended use.

1601
01:39:46.665 --> 01:39:53.800
The score sheet from the selection committee is also attached in the agenda item.

1602
01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:59.700
I'm pleased that there were 11 bids received,

1603
01:39:59.700 --> 01:40:05.925
so there's a great interest in doing work for the town and working with our staff.

1604
01:40:05.925 --> 01:40:10.080
Two of the bidders were deemed non-responsive as there was

1605
01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:15.940
a requirement for a Florida general contractor license.

1606
01:40:18.350 --> 01:40:23.220
I also would like to mention the benefits of the contract.

1607
01:40:23.220 --> 01:40:27.060
Much like the street resurfacing contract,

1608
01:40:27.060 --> 01:40:31.455
this contract will provide cost control and accelerated contract time.

1609
01:40:31.455 --> 01:40:38.490
It also will assist with staff workload for facility maintenance projects.

1610
01:40:38.490 --> 01:40:41.955
Some of the larger-scale mechanical,

1611
01:40:41.955 --> 01:40:46.950
electrical and plumbing projects can be utilized by this project to alleviate

1612
01:40:46.950 --> 01:40:48.690
stack workload for some of

1613
01:40:48.690 --> 01:40:53.205
the smaller-scale projects that could be utilized with in-house staff.

1614
01:40:53.205 --> 01:40:57.270
Also, this project was bid with FEMA provisions.

1615
01:40:57.270 --> 01:41:02.710
Work can be reimbursed and declared emergency revents.

1616
01:41:03.050 --> 01:41:08.310
One final note was that this contract was bid prior to

1617
01:41:08.310 --> 01:41:14.145
the bid qualification requirement for experience modification rate, or EMR.

1618
01:41:14.145 --> 01:41:19.690
However, staff confirmed that the contractors had an EMR of one.

1619
01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:24.090
With that, I'll answer any questions.

1620
01:41:24.090 --> 01:41:25.920
>> Any questions?

1621
01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:27.630
>> Just quickly. Tell me,

1622
01:41:27.630 --> 01:41:33.640
do you have any idea what the staff savings will be with this six million here?

1623
01:41:35.540 --> 01:41:41.730
>> It's hard to say because the projects are the smaller-scale projects,

1624
01:41:41.730 --> 01:41:46.435
and they'll be awarded on an individual project basis.

1625
01:41:46.435 --> 01:41:54.980
But the cost savings that we'll see can range anywhere from 10-15%

1626
01:41:54.980 --> 01:41:59.820
because the bid form provided the in-house

1627
01:41:59.820 --> 01:42:05.325
labor rates as well as subcontractor markup and material markup.

1628
01:42:05.325 --> 01:42:11.910
Some of the mark-ups that we received in the bids were 5%,

1629
01:42:11.910 --> 01:42:19.260
which is about 10% cheaper than usual bids that are about 15.

1630
01:42:19.260 --> 01:42:22.260
>> Then, with the FEMA reimbursement,

1631
01:42:22.260 --> 01:42:24.165
is that a wash?

1632
01:42:24.165 --> 01:42:31.155
Are we not getting FEMA reimbursements now for what we might get with this contract?

1633
01:42:31.155 --> 01:42:38.655
>> This is just a provision that we have in the bid a lot oftentimes to get reimbursed.

1634
01:42:38.655 --> 01:42:44.880
I can't speak for what was cost reimbursement in the past because I was not here,

1635
01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:48.480
but typically to utilize

1636
01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:56.400
vendors to be reimbursed for infrastructure repairs.

1637
01:42:56.400 --> 01:42:59.730
FEMA provisions need to be implemented in the bid.

1638
01:42:59.730 --> 01:43:00.870
They require bids.

1639
01:43:00.870 --> 01:43:03.510
This will just accelerate the time that we can get

1640
01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:07.215
projects done and we can get reimbursed quicker.

1641
01:43:07.215 --> 01:43:08.250
>> Thank you.

1642
01:43:08.250 --> 01:43:09.285
>> You are welcome.

1643
01:43:09.285 --> 01:43:10.410
>> Vice Mayor.

1644
01:43:10.410 --> 01:43:12.390
>> No questions, but I like the structure of this.

1645
01:43:12.390 --> 01:43:14.790
You did a nice drama with this. Appreciate it. Thank you.

1646
01:43:14.790 --> 01:43:16.710
>> Councilor Sundstrom.

1647
01:43:16.710 --> 01:43:17.940
>> My question answered.

1648
01:43:17.940 --> 01:43:22.210
Interesting material markup information there. Thank you.

1649
01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:25.540
>> No questions for me. Thank you.

1650
01:43:25.730 --> 01:43:32.790
>> Can you just explain probably in here and I hadn't seen,

1651
01:43:32.790 --> 01:43:35.550
but the work authorization process,

1652
01:43:35.550 --> 01:43:44.085
are all work authorizations signed without coming to counsel?

1653
01:43:44.085 --> 01:43:46.260
Because I've seen this recently,

1654
01:43:46.260 --> 01:43:50.010
where we had there may be a general dollar threshold.

1655
01:43:50.010 --> 01:43:51.240
I don't know what it exists,

1656
01:43:51.240 --> 01:43:54.270
but is there a dollar threshold that does come to council even

1657
01:43:54.270 --> 01:43:58.095
though you'd be using these contracts, question?

1658
01:43:58.095 --> 01:44:05.475
>> The intent was to utilize the threshold values within our procurement policy.

1659
01:44:05.475 --> 01:44:11.310
For say contracts less than $50,000,

1660
01:44:11.310 --> 01:44:13.845
it can be authorized by the town manager.

1661
01:44:13.845 --> 01:44:23.320
But projects with work order values greater certainly will go before council.

1662
01:44:25.610 --> 01:44:30.795
Most of the projects will be under 300,000 so they could be presented.

1663
01:44:30.795 --> 01:44:34.770
>> You answered the question and just to be clear,

1664
01:44:34.770 --> 01:44:37.650
so there's nothing in this that says whether it goes to

1665
01:44:37.650 --> 01:44:40.740
the council or nothing in the agreement,

1666
01:44:40.740 --> 01:44:44.850
because that's something perhaps we as a council can look at.

1667
01:44:44.850 --> 01:44:50.940
I'm okay with having a higher dollar value being authorized by the town manager.

1668
01:44:50.940 --> 01:44:54.990
Most contracts we see are not this type of contract.

1669
01:44:54.990 --> 01:44:59.160
It clearly says the mayor,

1670
01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:00.420
with the council,

1671
01:45:00.420 --> 01:45:03.735
makes the decision and other times town manager.

1672
01:45:03.735 --> 01:45:06.270
Just leave it as an open item doesn't

1673
01:45:06.270 --> 01:45:09.870
affect the agreement that I think 50,000 is too low.

1674
01:45:09.870 --> 01:45:14.910
It's just the absence of seeing it jump out that is why I asked that question.

1675
01:45:14.910 --> 01:45:18.310
Did you want to say something about that, Mr. Reynolds?

1676
01:45:18.380 --> 01:45:21.390
>> Thank you, Mayor. What I want to just quickly say

1677
01:45:21.390 --> 01:45:24.330
is you've mentioned this a couple of different times,

1678
01:45:24.330 --> 01:45:27.735
we do have a new procurement manager on staff.

1679
01:45:27.735 --> 01:45:31.710
We are currently reviewing the procurement policy.

1680
01:45:31.710 --> 01:45:34.185
I envision that there's going to be some changes,

1681
01:45:34.185 --> 01:45:37.440
and maybe some of those changes are exactly what you're talking about.

1682
01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:42.735
There could be some changes in the thresholds based on these types of activities.

1683
01:45:42.735 --> 01:45:45.090
>> One of the things I just want to point out

1684
01:45:45.090 --> 01:45:49.320
and recognize staff on this particular work,

1685
01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:51.165
and I realize all work is different.

1686
01:45:51.165 --> 01:45:54.180
This is an engineering services contractor services,

1687
01:45:54.180 --> 01:46:02.805
but I'm grateful that the bid evaluation assigned 70% the cost.

1688
01:46:02.805 --> 01:46:04.695
That's what I always advocate.

1689
01:46:04.695 --> 01:46:05.955
A lot of them,

1690
01:46:05.955 --> 01:46:09.330
the cost historically had been a lot lower.

1691
01:46:09.330 --> 01:46:10.905
I'm comforted by that.

1692
01:46:10.905 --> 01:46:20.640
I was also comforted by the fact that all four staff members evaluated 1,

1693
01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:22.755
02, 3, 4 the same.

1694
01:46:22.755 --> 01:46:30.960
I take comfort in that because I do believe that these were senior evaluations,

1695
01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:35.910
and all of them, just the fact that they were the same, gives me confidence.

1696
01:46:35.910 --> 01:46:37.380
That may not always be the case,

1697
01:46:37.380 --> 01:46:39.495
but that's why in this case,

1698
01:46:39.495 --> 01:46:41.700
I think the threshold could be higher,

1699
01:46:41.700 --> 01:46:45.075
but again, that's something you could come back on.

1700
01:46:45.075 --> 01:46:47.955
Because for a threshold to be higher,

1701
01:46:47.955 --> 01:46:52.155
I just want to always make sure that cost is given appropriate consideration,

1702
01:46:52.155 --> 01:46:54.300
which, in some cases, it hasn't been.

1703
01:46:54.300 --> 01:46:55.665
Again, good work.

1704
01:46:55.665 --> 01:47:00.250
I do think that, as you know,

1705
01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:05.120
how do you pronounce your name?

1706
01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:07.085
I guess I've been scared to say it?

1707
01:47:07.085 --> 01:47:09.620
>> The D is silent, Dzama.

1708
01:47:09.620 --> 01:47:12.330
>> Dzama. Thank you.

1709
01:47:13.490 --> 01:47:18.315
Anyway, in a long time,

1710
01:47:18.315 --> 01:47:21.540
I think I've heard you say that we have unit prices,

1711
01:47:21.540 --> 01:47:27.465
so you're going to know the cost for those projects that are that well defined.

1712
01:47:27.465 --> 01:47:30.240
>> Well, that was for their street resurfacing,

1713
01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:32.910
for this contract, it's a little different.

1714
01:47:32.910 --> 01:47:35.895
We have labor rates and we have markup.

1715
01:47:35.895 --> 01:47:38.025
We generally know the scope,

1716
01:47:38.025 --> 01:47:39.975
so we can really pin down.

1717
01:47:39.975 --> 01:47:42.705
We have cost control. We'll put it that way.

1718
01:47:42.705 --> 01:47:45.750
>> Now, realize, we talked earlier today,

1719
01:47:45.750 --> 01:47:48.900
the copy that I saw didn't have the amount

1720
01:47:48.900 --> 01:47:52.680
of unit rates because it wasn't in the hard copy that I got.

1721
01:47:52.680 --> 01:48:00.495
But anyway, I'm comfortable with this and appreciate answering the questions.

1722
01:48:00.495 --> 01:48:03.420
Thank you. If there's no more questions,

1723
01:48:03.420 --> 01:48:08.730
I'll take a motion in a second to approve Resolution 120-25.

1724
01:48:08.730 --> 01:48:09.720
>> Motion to approve.

1725
01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:10.635
>> Second.

1726
01:48:10.635 --> 01:48:12.300
>> Motion and a second. All in favor,

1727
01:48:12.300 --> 01:48:13.740
signify by saying aye.

1728
01:48:13.740 --> 01:48:14.490
>> [OVERLAPPING] Aye.

1729
01:48:14.490 --> 01:48:17.025
>> Motion carries unanimously.

1730
01:48:17.025 --> 01:48:19.635
Moving on to reports, Town attorney?

1731
01:48:19.635 --> 01:48:21.810
>> I have no report. Thank you, Mayor.

1732
01:48:21.810 --> 01:48:23.040
>> Town Manager?

1733
01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:25.695
>> Thank you, Mayor. Just a few things.

1734
01:48:25.695 --> 01:48:29.580
In October, residents began receiving invitations to

1735
01:48:29.580 --> 01:48:33.690
participate in the town citizen survey, as you all know.

1736
01:48:33.690 --> 01:48:36.000
Just for information purposes,

1737
01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.145
the survey is being operated by POCO,

1738
01:48:38.145 --> 01:48:42.030
the nation's leader in resident engagement in polling,

1739
01:48:42.030 --> 01:48:45.150
which conducts a science-based study for the town.

1740
01:48:45.150 --> 01:48:48.480
For those who POCO selected to take part in the survey,

1741
01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:51.840
you have until December 15 to complete the survey.

1742
01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:56.835
Selected participants will receive a postcard reminder in the mail in the coming days,

1743
01:48:56.835 --> 01:48:59.580
reminding them about how to participate.

1744
01:48:59.580 --> 01:49:02.520
Also, as a follow-up to an item that was raised during

1745
01:49:02.520 --> 01:49:05.190
the last town council meeting the town completed

1746
01:49:05.190 --> 01:49:11.220
construction on stormwater drainage improvements along Bush Road last Wednesday,

1747
01:49:11.220 --> 01:49:14.820
November 26, and the road has been reopened.

1748
01:49:14.820 --> 01:49:20.430
Next week, a contractor will perform asphalt milling and overlay to complete the project.

1749
01:49:20.430 --> 01:49:22.320
During this final phase of the project,

1750
01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:23.775
the road will remain open,

1751
01:49:23.775 --> 01:49:26.700
and flagman will manage traffic.

1752
01:49:26.700 --> 01:49:30.750
The town plans on using its social media website and email platforms to

1753
01:49:30.750 --> 01:49:35.565
communicate with the public about this roadwork before it begins.

1754
01:49:35.565 --> 01:49:38.070
Also, yesterday, the town launched

1755
01:49:38.070 --> 01:49:44.445
the new Citizen Recognition program called Jupiter's Home Town Heroes,

1756
01:49:44.445 --> 01:49:48.525
and this program allows residents to nominate a fellow resident,

1757
01:49:48.525 --> 01:49:52.710
business owner or volunteers who make a difference in the Jupiter community.

1758
01:49:52.710 --> 01:49:54.540
Once a nomination is received,

1759
01:49:54.540 --> 01:49:57.450
it'll be evaluated by a committee of town staff,

1760
01:49:57.450 --> 01:50:01.960
and those individuals selected will be honored at a town council meeting.

1761
01:50:03.620 --> 01:50:06.840
We began promoting this program yesterday through

1762
01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:10.410
the Town's social media email distribution list and website,

1763
01:50:10.410 --> 01:50:14.670
and have already begun to receive nominations, which is great.

1764
01:50:14.670 --> 01:50:17.070
We will continue to promote the program through

1765
01:50:17.070 --> 01:50:19.230
all of our distribution channels and look forward to

1766
01:50:19.230 --> 01:50:24.570
celebrating the community members who make us uniquely Jupiter in the near future.

1767
01:50:24.570 --> 01:50:28.980
I wanted to provide you with an update on our negotiations with

1768
01:50:28.980 --> 01:50:34.080
the PBA regarding a contract for our police sergeants and officers.

1769
01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:38.310
After multiple months of negotiations,

1770
01:50:38.310 --> 01:50:41.220
I'm happy to announce that the town and PBA have

1771
01:50:41.220 --> 01:50:44.655
reached a tentative agreement on a contract.

1772
01:50:44.655 --> 01:50:49.020
The PBA has scheduled a vote by our officers and

1773
01:50:49.020 --> 01:50:54.165
sergeants to ratify this contract on December 12 and December 15.

1774
01:50:54.165 --> 01:50:58.380
I also want to remind you that this ratification by

1775
01:50:58.380 --> 01:51:04.590
the officers is the required first step in the contract approval process.

1776
01:51:04.590 --> 01:51:06.840
Should the union ratify the contract,

1777
01:51:06.840 --> 01:51:12.405
we will bring the contract to the town council for a vote at the next available meeting,

1778
01:51:12.405 --> 01:51:13.710
and if all goes well,

1779
01:51:13.710 --> 01:51:17.940
that will be January 6, 2026.

1780
01:51:17.940 --> 01:51:20.985
We will not let any grass grow under our feet.

1781
01:51:20.985 --> 01:51:23.160
If that contract gets ratified,

1782
01:51:23.160 --> 01:51:25.635
you will see it at the first meeting in January.

1783
01:51:25.635 --> 01:51:28.305
Unfortunately, given the dates that they've selected,

1784
01:51:28.305 --> 01:51:33.730
I won't be able to get it on the agenda for the last meeting of the year.

1785
01:51:33.730 --> 01:51:36.800
>> Also, I want to close by reminding everyone of some of

1786
01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:40.775
the holiday events that occur in the town in the weeks ahead.

1787
01:51:40.775 --> 01:51:42.395
This Friday, December 5,

1788
01:51:42.395 --> 01:51:44.690
the town will hold its annual holiday tree lighting.

1789
01:51:44.690 --> 01:51:46.130
This year, the event has been moved to

1790
01:51:46.130 --> 01:51:49.865
the Town Green located here on the municipal campus.

1791
01:51:49.865 --> 01:51:56.300
I'm sure many of you saw the decorations and how amazing this campus looks right now.

1792
01:51:56.300 --> 01:52:01.580
I can't wait to see what it's going to look like on Friday night when the tree is lit up.

1793
01:52:01.580 --> 01:52:05.180
The event will begin at 5:00 PM and will feature food trucks,

1794
01:52:05.180 --> 01:52:07.730
performances by local schools and community groups,

1795
01:52:07.730 --> 01:52:09.695
and at 6:25 PM,

1796
01:52:09.695 --> 01:52:16.055
the official lighting of the Town's tree for the first time at the Town green will occur.

1797
01:52:16.055 --> 01:52:19.370
On Saturday evening, the annual Holiday Boat parade will be held and

1798
01:52:19.370 --> 01:52:22.760
should arrive in Jupiter between 7:30 and 8:00 PM.

1799
01:52:22.760 --> 01:52:24.950
On Saturday, December 13,

1800
01:52:24.950 --> 01:52:28.325
the town will hold its annual snow place like Jupiter event.

1801
01:52:28.325 --> 01:52:32.735
This event, always a favorite of children who get to play in the real snow,

1802
01:52:32.735 --> 01:52:37.745
will be held at Abacoa Community Park from 3:00 PM until 6:00 PM.

1803
01:52:37.745 --> 01:52:44.225
The annual JTAA holiday parade will occur on Sunday, December 14.

1804
01:52:44.225 --> 01:52:47.720
As a reminder, the town does not set the route for the parade.

1805
01:52:47.720 --> 01:52:49.955
We work with the JTAA committee,

1806
01:52:49.955 --> 01:52:53.630
and they select where they would like to have the parade,

1807
01:52:53.630 --> 01:52:56.315
and then we work to support their wishes,

1808
01:52:56.315 --> 01:53:00.750
which is what has occurred again this year. That's my report, Mayor.

1809
01:53:01.270 --> 01:53:06.620
>> Thank you. Councilor Choy?

1810
01:53:06.620 --> 01:53:09.440
>> Thank you, Mayor.

1811
01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:13.610
First, I want to thank all of the students that submitted

1812
01:53:13.610 --> 01:53:17.780
for the centennial art and poetry contest.

1813
01:53:17.780 --> 01:53:19.925
The winners were extraordinary.

1814
01:53:19.925 --> 01:53:22.940
The talent at such a young age.

1815
01:53:22.940 --> 01:53:25.790
Question for our town manager.

1816
01:53:25.790 --> 01:53:36.150
Will any of the winning entries can we get any recopy?

1817
01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:39.660
They were great.

1818
01:53:39.700 --> 01:53:44.990
I don't know what you call them when you get something that's reproduced from it?

1819
01:53:44.990 --> 01:53:47.000
Yeah, print. Thank you.

1820
01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:48.710
Just a thought.

1821
01:53:48.710 --> 01:53:50.585
They were great.

1822
01:53:50.585 --> 01:53:56.750
I also want to thank Chief Tennessee for that great update on the vessel. Thank you.

1823
01:53:56.750 --> 01:54:00.645
Again, to thank our Jupiter Police Department for everything that they do.

1824
01:54:00.645 --> 01:54:04.790
The town campus is like Disneyland.

1825
01:54:04.790 --> 01:54:06.200
I came in here tonight,

1826
01:54:06.200 --> 01:54:08.510
and I felt like a little kid in a candy store.

1827
01:54:08.510 --> 01:54:10.730
It looks beautiful.

1828
01:54:10.730 --> 01:54:12.875
It absolutely looks great.

1829
01:54:12.875 --> 01:54:17.120
I do want to thank all of the staff for their presentations tonight.

1830
01:54:17.120 --> 01:54:19.520
There was a lot of work put into everything,

1831
01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:22.805
and I do appreciate it. Thank you.

1832
01:54:22.805 --> 01:54:24.440
>> Vice Mayor.

1833
01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:28.910
>> Thank you, Mayor. The town green does look great.

1834
01:54:28.910 --> 01:54:31.070
You always said we're building everything out.

1835
01:54:31.070 --> 01:54:32.210
He said, "Do you see this thing?

1836
01:54:32.210 --> 01:54:34.010
It's going to look great." It really does.

1837
01:54:34.010 --> 01:54:38.345
But the lights just lit everything up. Just just one thing.

1838
01:54:38.345 --> 01:54:40.655
As you may or may not know,

1839
01:54:40.655 --> 01:54:42.740
Christmas is on a Thursday,

1840
01:54:42.740 --> 01:54:47.195
and town employees have Christmas Eve off, correct?

1841
01:54:47.195 --> 01:54:48.680
I would like to make a motion.

1842
01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:50.090
I think you all would agree to,

1843
01:54:50.090 --> 01:54:55.520
let's have the town employees to get the Friday off paid so they have a nice long break.

1844
01:54:55.520 --> 01:54:57.740
It's been a long year.

1845
01:54:57.740 --> 01:54:58.970
They've worked really hard,

1846
01:54:58.970 --> 01:55:04.910
so I would like to make a motion to give town employees December 26 off paid.

1847
01:55:04.910 --> 01:55:08.370
>> Just so it's clear,

1848
01:55:09.100 --> 01:55:11.900
they'll have Wednesday, Thursday,

1849
01:55:11.900 --> 01:55:15.380
is the current policy, correct?

1850
01:55:15.380 --> 01:55:17.105
>> That's correct, Mayor.

1851
01:55:17.105 --> 01:55:18.950
>> Okay. Then we're adding Friday.

1852
01:55:18.950 --> 01:55:20.765
We've done that before.

1853
01:55:20.765 --> 01:55:24.455
I'm okay with that. I just want to have the clarity of which was the days.

1854
01:55:24.455 --> 01:55:27.455
>> Yeah. It would be the 26th day after.

1855
01:55:27.455 --> 01:55:29.495
>> You want to make a motion for that?

1856
01:55:29.495 --> 01:55:30.245
>> I just did.

1857
01:55:30.245 --> 01:55:34.430
>> I would make it second [OVERLAPPING].

1858
01:55:34.430 --> 01:55:41.360
>> Motion to give town employees December 26 off paid.

1859
01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:42.650
>> I'll second the motion.

1860
01:55:42.650 --> 01:55:45.635
>> Motion and a second in favor signify by saying aye.

1861
01:55:45.635 --> 01:55:47.280
>> Aye.

1862
01:55:47.710 --> 01:55:52.130
>> Thank you, Vice Mayor. I know they'll appreciate that.

1863
01:55:52.130 --> 01:55:55.780
>> Nice break in the action. Thank you.

1864
01:55:55.780 --> 01:55:56.830
>> Anything else?

1865
01:55:56.830 --> 01:55:57.760
>> No, that's it.

1866
01:55:57.760 --> 01:56:01.300
>> There's three items. First of all, Town Manager,

1867
01:56:01.300 --> 01:56:04.045
the report about reaching

1868
01:56:04.045 --> 01:56:09.745
tentative agreement is the most thrilling thing I've heard in a while.

1869
01:56:09.745 --> 01:56:12.670
Oh, my gosh. Thank you.

1870
01:56:12.670 --> 01:56:18.875
I know there has been a lot of effort put into that by all parties and boy,

1871
01:56:18.875 --> 01:56:21.360
thank you for sharing that.

1872
01:56:21.610 --> 01:56:29.000
Obvious, hopefully you'll let us know as soon as you've heard the results from the vote,

1873
01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:34.720
and we are hopeful the tentative agreement means that it'll pass.

1874
01:56:34.720 --> 01:56:37.030
But it's been a long time.

1875
01:56:37.030 --> 01:56:38.365
We've been trying to get this done.

1876
01:56:38.365 --> 01:56:41.020
Thank you for the hard work and for getting it done.

1877
01:56:41.020 --> 01:56:45.090
The team and the union representatives.

1878
01:56:45.090 --> 01:56:47.000
No negative, all positive.

1879
01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:50.120
Thank you. Two small items.

1880
01:56:50.120 --> 01:56:53.060
I've been starting to use this as housekeeping things,

1881
01:56:53.060 --> 01:56:54.800
just to first of all,

1882
01:56:54.800 --> 01:56:56.390
and I think this is going to be addressed,

1883
01:56:56.390 --> 01:56:59.810
but it's interesting on the Bush Road closure,

1884
01:56:59.810 --> 01:57:05.165
when I saw when the town did the social media post that had been opened up,

1885
01:57:05.165 --> 01:57:07.820
and I had indicated that,

1886
01:57:07.820 --> 01:57:10.040
wow, I was really impacted by that.

1887
01:57:10.040 --> 01:57:12.395
I'm so glad when it opened up.

1888
01:57:12.395 --> 01:57:14.420
I already saw some people comment.

1889
01:57:14.420 --> 01:57:18.695
Well, it's going to be closed again for the intersection project.

1890
01:57:18.695 --> 01:57:20.750
I'm not asking for the answer here,

1891
01:57:20.750 --> 01:57:22.340
but in the weekly report,

1892
01:57:22.340 --> 01:57:23.900
because I would hope that maintenance of

1893
01:57:23.900 --> 01:57:28.310
traffic provisions would mean that it would not be closed,

1894
01:57:28.310 --> 01:57:30.485
but if it is going to be closed,

1895
01:57:30.485 --> 01:57:33.590
I bring this up now because the next time we see this as

1896
01:57:33.590 --> 01:57:38.270
a Council is when a contract award comes to us, right?

1897
01:57:38.270 --> 01:57:42.920
Normally there's maintenance of traffic,

1898
01:57:42.920 --> 01:57:45.170
but I don't know what that will mean.

1899
01:57:45.170 --> 01:57:48.290
If the engineering director can just share,

1900
01:57:48.290 --> 01:57:53.540
what's the expectation there with regard to whether Bush Road is going to

1901
01:57:53.540 --> 01:57:55.280
be closed for some period of

1902
01:57:55.280 --> 01:57:59.345
time for that when an intersection improvement project is done?

1903
01:57:59.345 --> 01:58:01.310
Again, I think the answer may be no,

1904
01:58:01.310 --> 01:58:04.790
but just to the degree that we may be getting questions

1905
01:58:04.790 --> 01:58:09.170
about that since it was just recently closed for close to two months.

1906
01:58:09.170 --> 01:58:13.070
I just would like all of us to get that answer.

1907
01:58:13.070 --> 01:58:15.050
Then lastly, it's a small item,

1908
01:58:15.050 --> 01:58:16.070
and I didn't bring it up,

1909
01:58:16.070 --> 01:58:18.230
but it's an important one nonetheless,

1910
01:58:18.230 --> 01:58:24.470
going forth because I believe what I heard about the water meter clearance requirements.

1911
01:58:24.470 --> 01:58:27.860
I'm sure it's not literal,

1912
01:58:27.860 --> 01:58:29.135
but I'll just say this.

1913
01:58:29.135 --> 01:58:36.110
I heard that there was a requirement of three feet of clearance around the meter box.

1914
01:58:36.110 --> 01:58:41.540
If I heard that correct and it wasn't worth bringing it up, first of all,

1915
01:58:41.540 --> 01:58:45.785
meters are generally coupled together,

1916
01:58:45.785 --> 01:58:48.800
two neighbors side by side, and one box.

1917
01:58:48.800 --> 01:58:52.835
It's always right on the property line,

1918
01:58:52.835 --> 01:58:57.710
and it's usually right on the front property line.

1919
01:58:57.710 --> 01:59:02.735
Well, that's a corner of the property so there's usually a sprinkler right there.

1920
01:59:02.735 --> 01:59:06.680
Hopefully, the clearance requirement doesn't take into account sprinklers,

1921
01:59:06.680 --> 01:59:09.065
or a lot of people are going to need to move sprinklers.

1922
01:59:09.065 --> 01:59:10.565
I don't think that's the case.

1923
01:59:10.565 --> 01:59:12.425
I can't imagine that's the case.

1924
01:59:12.425 --> 01:59:15.800
But then also, like my house happens to have a street light.

1925
01:59:15.800 --> 01:59:18.215
I can't imagine that's going to affect.

1926
01:59:18.215 --> 01:59:20.330
I think the answer is,

1927
01:59:20.330 --> 01:59:23.540
I'm just bringing that up to make sure that

1928
01:59:23.540 --> 01:59:26.660
they engineer it in a way that it isn't impactful because it

1929
01:59:26.660 --> 01:59:33.500
wasn't really clear what they meant by it has to be clear around the box.

1930
01:59:33.500 --> 01:59:36.950
I'm just trying to avoid and again,

1931
01:59:36.950 --> 01:59:38.075
they probably addressed it,

1932
01:59:38.075 --> 01:59:39.230
but now that was said tonight,

1933
01:59:39.230 --> 01:59:44.270
and I don't want to wait until letters start going out,

1934
01:59:44.270 --> 01:59:48.350
and people start thinking they have to relocate things that hopefully

1935
01:59:48.350 --> 01:59:53.540
they don't have to that's it. Councilor Sundstrom,.

1936
01:59:53.540 --> 01:59:55.700
>> I'll go in order,

1937
01:59:55.700 --> 01:59:57.320
I just made a quick list here.

1938
01:59:57.320 --> 02:00:00.125
First, I just want to make a point to the threshold,

1939
02:00:00.125 --> 02:00:01.745
the 50k threshold,

1940
02:00:01.745 --> 02:00:03.200
and our procurement standards.

1941
02:00:03.200 --> 02:00:05.570
I do hope that we look at that.

1942
02:00:05.570 --> 02:00:07.775
We haven't changed that threshold in years.

1943
02:00:07.775 --> 02:00:09.260
If we think about inflation,

1944
02:00:09.260 --> 02:00:11.330
everything else, the cost of doing business,

1945
02:00:11.330 --> 02:00:16.700
I am glad that we have so many items coming up here,

1946
02:00:16.700 --> 02:00:20.040
but I don't necessarily want that many.

1947
02:00:20.140 --> 02:00:24.380
I know other municipalities will do really high thresholds,

1948
02:00:24.380 --> 02:00:26.585
and they don't see a lot of what happens.

1949
02:00:26.585 --> 02:00:28.385
A lot of business doesn't come up to the Council.

1950
02:00:28.385 --> 02:00:31.010
I think we've had a good run,

1951
02:00:31.010 --> 02:00:36.830
but we do need to look at how costs have changed and our rate of doing business.

1952
02:00:36.830 --> 02:00:38.540
I would be supportive of that going forward,

1953
02:00:38.540 --> 02:00:40.565
and I'm glad it's being reviewed.

1954
02:00:40.565 --> 02:00:43.220
I didn't bring up an item tonight either,

1955
02:00:43.220 --> 02:00:46.310
but I did want to just bring attention to Item 7 which is the approval of

1956
02:00:46.310 --> 02:00:50.285
the 82-month purchasing agreement for the Police Department in car video system.

1957
02:00:50.285 --> 02:00:52.385
I think that's fantastic.

1958
02:00:52.385 --> 02:00:57.410
In the past, I've pulled items just to call out how we're using technology to improve

1959
02:00:57.410 --> 02:00:59.525
our operational efficiency and

1960
02:00:59.525 --> 02:01:03.830
effectiveness in our police department and public safety as a whole.

1961
02:01:03.830 --> 02:01:08.930
There are officers who to transfer the video in older systems,

1962
02:01:08.930 --> 02:01:11.210
it would take something like half an hour.

1963
02:01:11.210 --> 02:01:15.845
I mean, people are held up and across all the videos that they have to do.

1964
02:01:15.845 --> 02:01:21.245
It's taking a ton of time so I'm so grateful that that is done away with.

1965
02:01:21.245 --> 02:01:25.205
We have in place a couple of license plate readers around town.

1966
02:01:25.205 --> 02:01:28.535
Now every single vehicle will have that technology.

1967
02:01:28.535 --> 02:01:31.250
It's not just for stolen vehicles or other things like that,

1968
02:01:31.250 --> 02:01:33.800
it could be missing persons, or if someone needs help.

1969
02:01:33.800 --> 02:01:38.210
I love that we have that capability or that we're going to have that capability.

1970
02:01:38.210 --> 02:01:41.060
I love that it's going to serve our department, our officers,

1971
02:01:41.060 --> 02:01:44.810
and our public, and I love this use of technology.

1972
02:01:44.810 --> 02:01:47.090
I just think that the public should be aware of that,

1973
02:01:47.090 --> 02:01:50.600
that we're about to have all of this functionality and efficiency,

1974
02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:52.400
and it should be celebrated.

1975
02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:55.310
Thank you again, Jupiter Police Department.

1976
02:01:55.310 --> 02:01:57.455
That brings me to PBA.

1977
02:01:57.455 --> 02:02:03.390
I am so thrilled to hear that. You have no idea.

1978
02:02:04.360 --> 02:02:08.630
There's not much to say except for we're happy about this.

1979
02:02:08.630 --> 02:02:10.970
Then, the Hometown Heroes program,

1980
02:02:10.970 --> 02:02:12.935
thank you, Town Manager, for that.

1981
02:02:12.935 --> 02:02:16.250
I think we just recently celebrated an astronaut.

1982
02:02:16.250 --> 02:02:21.200
I've heard we had a [inaudible] award one time for a Grinch or other things.

1983
02:02:21.200 --> 02:02:24.830
But just recognizing all of the good in this town and all of

1984
02:02:24.830 --> 02:02:28.280
the incredible people in this town and the way they step

1985
02:02:28.280 --> 02:02:32.030
up in ways seen and unseen I think,

1986
02:02:32.030 --> 02:02:36.860
is just so worth highlighting and will be some good news.

1987
02:02:36.860 --> 02:02:39.320
We don't always have that in this world today.

1988
02:02:39.320 --> 02:02:45.480
I think it's a great small-town feel element. Thank you.

1989
02:02:47.110 --> 02:02:50.645
>> I think about being lash and just go ditto.

1990
02:02:50.645 --> 02:02:54.215
Whatever to say, but I

1991
02:02:54.215 --> 02:02:56.810
appreciate all the presentations made that night

1992
02:02:56.810 --> 02:02:59.240
and all the detail and hard work that went into all of it.

1993
02:02:59.240 --> 02:03:02.225
Good news with the PBA contract negotiation.

1994
02:03:02.225 --> 02:03:03.665
I think everybody feels the same.

1995
02:03:03.665 --> 02:03:05.900
Hopefully, that'll get ratified and behind us,

1996
02:03:05.900 --> 02:03:08.000
and we'll see it in January.

1997
02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.460
The Town Citizen Survey,

1998
02:03:10.460 --> 02:03:13.520
how will those results be communicated to the Council?

1999
02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:17.250
You guys may know, but now I'll at least ask the town manager.

2000
02:03:17.710 --> 02:03:20.390
>> Councilor, I can't see you with all this.

2001
02:03:20.390 --> 02:03:21.635
>> I know all the flowers.

2002
02:03:21.635 --> 02:03:24.710
>> [inaudible] but I'm sure you're down there, somewhere I can hear you.

2003
02:03:24.710 --> 02:03:28.205
What will happen is once we get the result,

2004
02:03:28.205 --> 02:03:31.460
we'll do a presentation for Council.

2005
02:03:31.460 --> 02:03:39.455
Typically, what happens is the vendors will come in and share with us the methodology,

2006
02:03:39.455 --> 02:03:41.525
how many surveys went out.

2007
02:03:41.525 --> 02:03:43.655
How they tallied up the results,

2008
02:03:43.655 --> 02:03:46.745
and then they'll go through the different classifications.

2009
02:03:46.745 --> 02:03:48.395
They'll tell us how we did,

2010
02:03:48.395 --> 02:03:55.310
and they'll do a comparative analysis with other municipalities,

2011
02:03:55.310 --> 02:03:59.150
our size and dimension,

2012
02:03:59.150 --> 02:04:01.505
I mean, the dynamics that we have.

2013
02:04:01.505 --> 02:04:05.255
It's usually a pretty comprehensive presentation.

2014
02:04:05.255 --> 02:04:08.270
>> Then will staff then put together action plans that we'll

2015
02:04:08.270 --> 02:04:11.870
see how we're going to address the significant comments?

2016
02:04:11.870 --> 02:04:16.775
>> Yes, we will. The first step of that is to present it to the Council.

2017
02:04:16.775 --> 02:04:19.070
We'll get a feel for what's coming.

2018
02:04:19.070 --> 02:04:22.580
But the first thing we want to do is get the direction from you

2019
02:04:22.580 --> 02:04:26.735
all on what's important to you and what you want to see done first.

2020
02:04:26.735 --> 02:04:35.375
I'm hopeful and optimistic that those survey results will be as they typically are,

2021
02:04:35.375 --> 02:04:40.550
which puts us pretty close to the top of most categories.

2022
02:04:40.550 --> 02:04:44.720
But the pressures on us right now and so we're anxious to see the results of that.

2023
02:04:44.720 --> 02:04:46.220
>> My last comment was,

2024
02:04:46.220 --> 02:04:50.810
I'm on the ears on for the Art Committee.

2025
02:04:50.810 --> 02:04:54.410
I had the benefit of sitting at the last meeting.

2026
02:04:54.410 --> 02:04:57.980
They actually went through all the various arts, poetry,

2027
02:04:57.980 --> 02:04:59.090
and poems, essays,

2028
02:04:59.090 --> 02:05:01.715
and everything put together and selected the winners.

2029
02:05:01.715 --> 02:05:03.380
I just witnessed the whole thing,

2030
02:05:03.380 --> 02:05:09.485
but I did listen in on the essays and the poems that were written by these students,

2031
02:05:09.485 --> 02:05:13.730
and they all were very good and emphasized why we love living in Jupiter.

2032
02:05:13.730 --> 02:05:17.600
I think they mentioned that they're going to be on the website.

2033
02:05:17.600 --> 02:05:21.275
I encourage members of the Council to go out and read them.

2034
02:05:21.275 --> 02:05:24.035
They're quite good. I know you asked for the artwork,

2035
02:05:24.035 --> 02:05:25.850
which is a lot of good work there,

2036
02:05:25.850 --> 02:05:29.255
but the essays and poems were quite good, also. Thank you.

2037
02:05:29.255 --> 02:05:31.550
>> I'm glad you brought that up because I was going to ask

2038
02:05:31.550 --> 02:05:35.520
the same question if we could get copies of those essays.

2039
02:05:35.530 --> 02:05:38.315
>> Just one follow-up,

2040
02:05:38.315 --> 02:05:44.465
that Councilor Guisinger brought up with regard to the Citizen survey, number one,

2041
02:05:44.465 --> 02:05:50.765
I think historically, we get a copy of the survey results before the presentation.

2042
02:05:50.765 --> 02:05:54.110
Because that's helpful, then when we get we then

2043
02:05:54.110 --> 02:05:57.260
can ask the consultants a one-time to ask them.

2044
02:05:57.260 --> 02:06:01.400
Then number two, because I know all of us spent a lot of time,

2045
02:06:01.400 --> 02:06:05.435
that's extremely important valuable information.

2046
02:06:05.435 --> 02:06:08.840
But if you didn't already know,

2047
02:06:08.840 --> 02:06:15.260
the specific questions that we add are always tailored towards

2048
02:06:15.260 --> 02:06:22.355
something that's significant to us from a potential policy setting item.

2049
02:06:22.355 --> 02:06:25.760
Probably most of us will go right to those questions as

2050
02:06:25.760 --> 02:06:29.720
the starting point because that's not how we've done.

2051
02:06:29.720 --> 02:06:34.550
It's what the citizens in Public are saying going forth on issues

2052
02:06:34.550 --> 02:06:39.170
of importance so very anxious to see that.

2053
02:06:39.170 --> 02:06:41.795
Because again, we picked that as a Council,

2054
02:06:41.795 --> 02:06:45.540
just a reminder of those questions.

2055
02:06:46.240 --> 02:06:50.450
With that, the time is now 9:06,

2056
02:06:50.450 --> 02:06:52.560
and I will adjourn the meeting.
