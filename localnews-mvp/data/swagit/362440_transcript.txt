[00:01:36.520] >> Here.

[00:01:38.930] >> Thank you. We begin tonight.

[00:01:41.650] First item on the agenda,

[00:01:43.140] we have an exciting item.

[00:01:45.870] It's presentation on the Centennial Art and Poetry Contest winners.

[00:01:52.820] >> Good evening, council and members of the public here.

[00:01:58.060] We have an exciting item for you tonight.

[00:02:02.850] Let me just pull it up here,

[00:02:05.040] on our art and poetry contest.

[00:02:09.990] Our department, Planning and Zoning,

[00:02:12.960] has done over 20 events for celebrating the centennial, starting in January.

[00:02:19.400] We've got one next week coming up, hopefully,

[00:02:24.175] if we can get another two bus tours and open house and

[00:02:28.720] a children's archaeological event next week at the Sawfish Bay Park.

[00:02:35.800] But tonight, we want to talk about celebrating

[00:02:39.100] the students who submitted for the art and poetry contest,

[00:02:43.440] and with us today is Thatcher Hart.

[00:02:47.020] He is senior planner and Historic Resources Board liaison.

[00:02:52.240] I'm going to open this up. There we go.

[00:03:03.260] >> Good evening, council, pleasure to be here.

[00:03:06.810] This is an exciting item that we can be here and celebrate.

[00:03:10.430] As mentioned by Stephanie Thoburn,

[00:03:12.550] the art and poetry contest here was for students in the area.

[00:03:17.270] What we were working with is that we gave the students in

[00:03:20.470] the area a prompt of what does Jupiter mean to them.

[00:03:23.600] With that, they had to provide a piece of art for K through fifth grade.

[00:03:32.250] Then they also had to submit a piece of art as well as a essay

[00:03:36.230] or a piece of poetry to go along with the art,

[00:03:40.270] describing the art and going with the same theme of what Jupiter really means to them.

[00:03:44.470] Like I said, it was for students within the Jupiter area.

[00:03:47.540] It was open to anyone that was willing to apply for both private,

[00:03:51.550] public, and home-schooled students.

[00:03:54.575] It was, in collaboration,

[00:03:57.710] judged by the Town of Jupiter Art Committee.

[00:03:59.790] We worked with them, and they went through

[00:04:01.790] the submissions and worked to determine who would win the awards.

[00:04:07.140] We broke down the submissions into four divisions.

[00:04:10.900] The first division was kindergarten through second grade,

[00:04:13.080] and they were required to submit one piece of art only.

[00:04:16.140] Division 2 is third grade through fifth grade, with one piece of art.

[00:04:20.100] Then for the middle school division,

[00:04:22.380] they were required to submit the one piece of art as well as

[00:04:25.380] one essay or piece of poetry to go along with their artwork.

[00:04:29.580] As well as high school,

[00:04:30.880] they had to provide a piece of art as well as one essay piece of poetry.

[00:04:38.400] Really important to mention that we couldn't do

[00:04:41.300] this with our sponsors, the Loxahatchee Guild.

[00:04:43.460] They were graciously supportive of this effort

[00:04:46.120] and providing us the awards that the students will receive tonight.

[00:04:50.000] Kim Ryan here is tonight and representing Loxahatchee Guild,

[00:04:53.770] as well as Mary Therese.

[00:04:55.145] We're really grateful for them to provide support for this effort.

[00:04:58.780] As well, we collaborated with the Palm Beach County Library system

[00:05:02.500] and worked with Bernadette Dickson to work with them and

[00:05:06.620] we will be presenting or displaying the artwork that won

[00:05:10.320] tonight's contest at the Jupiter Branch Library as well for the public to see.

[00:05:17.990] We'll start with Division 1,

[00:05:20.290] which is kindergarten through second grade.

[00:05:21.950] We'll call up the winners here and we have a nice little goody bag for them. I'm sorry?

[00:05:26.850] >> If I may come up?

[00:05:28.335] >> Yes, please. Do you want to do the honors?

[00:05:34.295] >> You want me to say something?

[00:05:38.045] >> Sure.

[00:05:40.160] >> Good evening. We're from the Loxahatchee Guild,

[00:05:43.585] and Mary Therese, our president, is here as well.

[00:05:46.230] We just want to say how happy we are to be with you on this.

[00:05:50.210] You know we've supported you in past projects,

[00:05:53.410] and we're proud of that.

[00:05:54.750] We're proud of what you've accomplished and what we've accomplished.

[00:05:58.665] It was fun to do this.

[00:06:00.690] I'm a retired guidance counselor,

[00:06:03.270] so it's fun to see kids again.

[00:06:06.140] [LAUGHTER] Thank you for including us on this.

[00:06:09.470] >> Awesome. We have the first-place winner in Division 1.

[00:06:14.295] We have Oliver. Oliver here?

[00:06:16.950] I don't believe Oliver is here, actually,

[00:06:19.390] but he won a $50 gift card,

[00:06:22.140] so congratulations to Oliver.

[00:06:29.690] [APPLAUSE] For Division 2, which is third grade rough fifth grade,

[00:06:33.030] they also had a piece of art.

[00:06:34.470] In second place, we had Shiven Solanki. Is she here?

[00:06:38.445] No? Shiven also we won a $25 gift card.

[00:06:43.950] [APPLAUSE] In first place for Division 2,

[00:06:50.370] we have Ethan Tagle.

[00:07:00.675] >> Congratulations. Very good job.

[00:07:09.275] >> Excellent. Congratulations, Ethan.

[00:07:11.260] [APPLAUSE] For Division 3,

[00:07:17.375] which is middle school, they had to submit the one piece of art as well

[00:07:19.820] as essay or poetry to go along with it.

[00:07:24.160] For third place, we have Summer Hahner.

[00:07:27.840] Is Summer here? Excellent. Come on up. [APPLAUSE]

[00:07:35.240] >> Congratulations, my dear.

[00:07:37.635] >> Congratulations.

[00:07:38.430] >> Thank you.

[00:07:41.840] >> Congratulations. [APPLAUSE] For second place in Division 3,

[00:09:27.230] Is Alice here? No?

[00:09:29.288] >> No.

[00:09:30.200] >> Unfortunately.

[00:09:32.320] >> Well, congratulations to all participants.

[00:09:39.470] [APPLAUSE] If everyone could come on up,

[00:09:42.750] that would be interested in taking a picture with the council,

[00:09:46.430] we would like to get a group photo.

[00:09:49.740] [BACKGROUND]

[00:10:17.615] >> One step up. There we go.

[00:10:21.190] Then, councilors, if you can stand behind [inaudible] There we go.

[00:10:29.200] [LAUGHTER] Thank you, and the town manager.

[00:10:37.295] >> If I could have front row slightly stand behind.

[00:10:41.360] >> Behind?

[00:10:41.570] >> Yeah, right behind. [BACKGROUND]

[00:10:43.010] >> A little bit more.

[00:10:50.180] [LAUGHTER] You can try to face the

[00:11:14.480] [inaudible] [APPLAUSE]

[00:11:27.830] >> [BACKGROUND] Thank you, everyone, for participating.

[00:11:30.250] As I mentioned previously,

[00:11:31.530] copies of the art will be on display at the Jupiter Branch Library,

[00:11:35.050] and the actual essays and poetry are available

[00:11:37.710] for review on our town webpage on the centennial webpage.

[00:11:41.075] Thank you all very much, appreciate it.

[00:11:47.600] >> Thank you to the students,

[00:11:50.250] to the parents for encouraging them, and family members.

[00:11:53.505] Thank you especially, Loxahatchee Guild,

[00:11:55.475] for helping to sponsor this. Thank you.

[00:12:17.650] [BACKGROUND] Next, we have a presentation on anchored vessels,

[00:12:22.230] an update from our police chief.

[00:12:38.130] >> Good evening, Mayor, town council.

[00:12:40.730] Interim Chief Don Hennessy of the police department.

[00:12:42.925] We want to take a few minutes tonight to go through to

[00:12:45.150] provide you and the community with an update as

[00:12:47.550] to some of the efforts taken by JPD staff on the anchored vessel issue,

[00:12:52.130] and also some of our plans moving forward with the program.

[00:12:56.870] We're going to start with some of the removals that have occurred over the past year.

[00:13:00.430] We'll talk about what the current situation looks like,

[00:13:03.510] what anchored vessels are currently within Jupiter's waterways and their locations.

[00:13:08.190] We're going to discuss a new program that launched a couple of months ago,

[00:13:11.410] called Operation Barnacle Busters.

[00:13:13.610] Then we'll conclude with legislative update on two major House bills

[00:13:18.110] that have gone through the legislature and have or are going to take effect shortly.

[00:13:24.250] To start with, look at the derelict vessel removals over the past year.

[00:13:29.095] The Jupiter Police Marine Unit has coordinated the removal of three vessels; one,

[00:13:34.345] August 1st of '25,

[00:13:35.895] and the other two were back in March of '25.

[00:13:39.905] That's consistent with the prior year.

[00:13:42.430] There were three vessels removed also that year as well.

[00:13:46.170] Again, those vessels were the Billy B,

[00:13:48.520] the Obsession II, and Last Fling.

[00:13:51.250] Current status of vessels inside Jupiter's waterways,

[00:13:55.180] we had the marine unit go out and give us a status of where we sit today with vessels.

[00:13:59.730] You'll see the majority of the vessels in

[00:14:01.570] the Top 2 categories there sit in the intercoastal waterway,

[00:14:05.130] south of Indiantown Road,

[00:14:06.570] just south of the bridge.

[00:14:07.770] Then there were 12 in the area of Burt Reynolds West.

[00:14:11.930] There were a couple of vessels in other locations,

[00:14:14.110] but they seem to be congregating in those two main areas of the town's waterways.

[00:14:22.800] There we go. To talk about Operation Barnacle Busters,

[00:14:27.040] and we've introduced this in some prior meetings in very vague terms,

[00:14:31.200] but I want to take a second to go through and tell you where it came from.

[00:14:35.315] Members of our marine unit and our dive team came up with

[00:14:38.580] the idea to inspect vessels' means of propulsion,

[00:14:43.320] which is one of the requirements by

[00:14:44.660] Florida State Statute that a vessel have an effective means of propulsion.

[00:14:48.265] To do that, we always had concerns about whether we were

[00:14:52.230] going to have people test their propulsion from a safety factor.

[00:14:55.770] If we're saying they can't propulse,

[00:14:57.790] what is the way to do that safely?

[00:14:59.990] Well, our staff came up with an idea to

[00:15:01.990] utilize our underwater recovery team, our dive team,

[00:15:05.150] to go underwater and take photos and try to inspect

[00:15:09.110] these propulsion systems from a more manual standpoint.

[00:15:13.530] We began this in September of 2025.

[00:15:16.690] During that first inspection,

[00:15:18.570] there were 18 written warnings issued for not having effective means of propulsion.

[00:15:23.540] Now you'll see on the right-hand side of the slide there,

[00:15:26.665] that's two photos of two of the prop systems that the marine unit and dive team located.

[00:15:32.830] They actually went up and physically tried to manipulate

[00:15:36.290] those props and found that they were not able to turn and not able to move.

[00:15:40.690] There were 18 written warnings issued in September of 2025.

[00:15:44.465] The following month, as we're enforcing this,

[00:15:49.490] the statute requires a minimum of 30 days between violations,

[00:15:55.940] so we weren't able to go out and do the next round of inspections until October of 2025.

[00:16:01.370] During that, of the 18,

[00:16:03.430] nine were remaining with violations in our waterways.

[00:16:07.230] Nine citations were written for that violation.

[00:16:10.750] Those nine citations will be the first level

[00:16:14.970] of three citations that could possibly lead to a designation of an at-risk vessel,

[00:16:20.590] which then would start the process of removal.

[00:16:24.170] Again, we're one round of citations through this.

[00:16:26.890] We have a second round of inspections,

[00:16:29.990] which technically be our third round,

[00:16:32.130] but our second round of citation inspections.

[00:16:34.970] That will take place December 9th.

[00:16:37.150] That's already coordinated with our underwater recovery team,

[00:16:39.900] and our marine needs to go do those inspections.

[00:16:42.320] We'll be following up with all of the vessels in Jupiter's waterways on a monthly basis,

[00:16:47.060] particularly those with violations.

[00:16:49.680] Once a vessel comes into compliance,

[00:16:53.340] we'll look at inspecting that vessel quarterly,

[00:16:56.100] just to make sure that once they've resolved

[00:16:58.260] the condition that caused them to be in violation,

[00:17:00.640] we want to make sure it stays there.

[00:17:02.140] Those will be put on a quarterly inspection process.

[00:17:08.580] >> Again, I mentioned at the beginning,

[00:17:10.690] there were two new house bills that passed.

[00:17:12.700] This one, House Bill 481 took effect already July 1 of 2025.

[00:17:17.755] This house bill allows local municipalities,

[00:17:21.265] specifically municipalities and counties that have a population of 1,500,000. or more,

[00:17:27.295] which limits it to four coastal counties: Hillsboro,

[00:17:30.745] Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami Dale.

[00:17:34.450] Orange County also meets the definition.

[00:17:36.580] However, the more inland and don't really apply here.

[00:17:39.910] I will tell you the current statute,

[00:17:42.175] what it actually requires is a little ambiguous.

[00:17:47.035] At the time they're still working through some definitions on it.

[00:17:50.880] But what it basically requires,

[00:17:53.080] it allows us to create an ordinance that regulates overnight anchoring to where

[00:17:57.400] a vessel cannot anchor for more than 30 days in a six month period.

[00:18:05.730] Now, a couple of questions I have with that,

[00:18:08.635] is it 30 consecutive days in that six month period,

[00:18:12.280] and is it in the same location?

[00:18:14.275] For instance, if somebody's anchored at Burt Reynolds Park,

[00:18:17.020] and they relocate down south of Indian Town Road Bridge,

[00:18:21.070] does that start the clock all over again?

[00:18:23.245] The statute is not clear at this point on what we're allowed to regulate in that case,

[00:18:31.300] there's still some clarity that has to be done on that.

[00:18:34.300] One other thing to mention with

[00:18:35.800] House Bill 481 and the possible creation of that ordinance,

[00:18:39.400] possible violations would be dealt with through the Municipal ordinance citation system.

[00:18:44.665] Those municipal citations would not count

[00:18:48.040] towards the consecutive violation rule that would lead to removal.

[00:18:53.650] Therefore, if we were to create an ordinance here,

[00:18:56.260] it would not advance towards removal of that vessel,

[00:19:00.820] it would only follow our municipal citation system.

[00:19:05.125] There are only two municipalities that have

[00:19:07.960] currently enacted ordinances under this house bill.

[00:19:10.960] One is Miami Dale and the other is the town of Palm Beach,

[00:19:14.905] due to the fact that this is new since it started in July,

[00:19:18.310] there's been limited results and

[00:19:20.380] limited reviews on how efficient it is in taking care of anchored vessel problem.

[00:19:26.845] Staff will continue to monitor those two ordinances and

[00:19:30.130] any future changes to this House bill to see if it adds any more clarity moving forward.

[00:19:37.050] The other House bill,

[00:19:39.085] House Bill 1149,

[00:19:40.615] this one has not yet taken effect,

[00:19:42.250] but is scheduled to take effect,

[00:19:43.450] January 1 of 2026.

[00:19:46.030] This is more of a state level bill versus the ordinance.

[00:19:50.215] This creates a permit process that is coordinated by

[00:19:53.230] the Fish and Wildlife Commission that would allow vessels to apply for,

[00:19:57.250] and obtain a long term anchoring permit.

[00:20:01.050] The way they defined long term anchoring is you can anchor any,

[00:20:06.985] this gets a little confusing,

[00:20:08.200] but it's anywhere within a one nautical mile of a documented anchorage point.

[00:20:12.625] Basically, to put it in simple terms,

[00:20:14.740] if I anchor outside Burt Reynolds and I call the state to get a permit,

[00:20:19.690] and they issue me that permit then that

[00:20:21.970] long term anchoring permit allows me to anchor anywhere

[00:20:24.100] within 1.15 miles of Burt Reynolds Park of where I was.

[00:20:29.455] That would be something where we don't have any say

[00:20:32.740] in who gets the permits or how the permits are issued.

[00:20:35.485] Those are strictly issued by Fish and Wildlife.

[00:20:38.125] We've been in communication with Fish and Wildlife.

[00:20:40.630] They're still in the process of creating

[00:20:43.690] this permit process and identifying what that looks like.

[00:20:47.365] Staff have been constantly reaching out to

[00:20:50.080] them to check to see if they've made any progress,

[00:20:52.570] where they sit with it and what exactly that looks like.

[00:20:55.855] I will tell you that any violations, say, for example,

[00:20:59.770] somebody was anchoring within Jupiter's Waterways,

[00:21:02.665] and they did not have one of these permits,

[00:21:05.290] and they violate that long term anchoring rule,

[00:21:07.690] it would result in a uniform boating citation,

[00:21:10.690] which is a state level citation that would then count

[00:21:13.480] towards subsequent violations toward removal.

[00:21:16.945] This would give us the opportunity to evaluate that for subsequent violations.

[00:21:23.695] We will continue to monitor the implementation of this statute,

[00:21:27.310] as like I said, the program is not fully fleshed out by the state at this point,

[00:21:31.165] but we're going to keep our eyes on this thing and see if that may

[00:21:35.110] be the most efficient option for the town moving forward.

[00:21:41.340] Some key takeaways,

[00:21:43.420] Police Department remains proactive in vessel monitoring and enforcement efforts.

[00:21:47.585] The Barnacle Busters operation.

[00:21:49.590] Again, I give credit to the Marine Unit and our underwater recovery team

[00:21:52.620] for putting that together and having the idea to think outside the box,

[00:21:56.295] and come up with a solution to try to help us manage this.

[00:22:00.610] Then Police Department staff is continuing monitoring new and proposed legislation,

[00:22:04.330] including House Bill 481 and 1149.

[00:22:08.545] With that, I can take any questions you may have regarding the new legislation,

[00:22:12.940] Barnacle busters or our activities so far.

[00:22:15.710] >> Counsel, have any questions?

[00:22:17.430] >> I have a couple of questions. On your page 5,

[00:22:19.830] chief, you mentioned the 18 written.

[00:22:22.830] Well, first of all, are people living on these boats?

[00:22:25.530] >> Some of them, yes.

[00:22:26.990] >> Do you know if are they residents of the town or there's out of town folks?

[00:22:31.000] [OVERLAPPING] Come down the warm weather or?

[00:22:33.925] >> I don't know where they live, the specific boats.

[00:22:37.645] >> On the 18 written warnings and 9 citations,

[00:22:41.785] were those 9 written warnings?

[00:22:44.080] Were they corrected then so you didn't have for any more citations?

[00:22:46.690] >> Some of them were corrected.

[00:22:47.995] Some of the people fixed the problem that we identified,

[00:22:51.070] and some of them had moved on to other locations.

[00:22:54.145] >> My last question,

[00:22:56.935] under that create the permitting process that the State may be looking at,

[00:23:01.165] do those vessels as part of their permitting process have to show operability?

[00:23:05.875] >> They do not. There is a stipulation in

[00:23:09.910] the statute that if those vessels do become derelict at any point or at risk,

[00:23:14.395] then that permit it will be vacated,

[00:23:16.855] so they will lose their permit,

[00:23:18.250] but that's going through the full derelict process as we would now.

[00:23:21.610] There's no scheduled regular inspections required.

[00:23:24.910] >> Thank you. Good presentation. I appreciate the answers too.

[00:23:28.290] >> Counsel San any questions.

[00:23:30.745] >> No questions. I just want to say that I greatly appreciate this police department.

[00:23:36.040] I appreciate your leadership,

[00:23:37.315] Chief Hennessy, for being so proactive.

[00:23:40.795] I mean, from being in touch with FWC on this House bill and

[00:23:44.860] following up with them constantly to proactively checking,

[00:23:49.240] using the dive teams, all of that.

[00:23:51.175] I just want to say it's very impressive. Thank you.

[00:23:54.220] >> Thank you.

[00:23:55.120] >> Any questions?

[00:23:56.320] >> Yes, I do. I will go back to page 5, Operation Barnacle.

[00:23:59.650] When citations or written warnings are given,

[00:24:05.215] how do you communicate that to the vessel owner?

[00:24:08.965] >> A lot of times they're certified mailed.

[00:24:10.795] If they're actually on the vessel,

[00:24:12.220] it's delivered by hand.

[00:24:13.780] Those who are not on the vessel,

[00:24:15.310] they're delivered by certified mail.

[00:24:16.600] >> But you do have access to an address because?

[00:24:19.810] >> Yes. We have identified owners of all of these vessels.

[00:24:23.155] >> With those citations or warnings,

[00:24:25.810] are there any monetary fines imposed to these folks?

[00:24:30.070] >> What happens is it goes through the state court process,

[00:24:33.085] so they will go through the court process and then that judge or Magistrate would impose

[00:24:37.795] those fines at that point keeping in

[00:24:40.570] mind that as we go through two subsequent violations,

[00:24:43.540] the first, the second, the third,

[00:24:45.340] it does require adjudication of anything other than dismissed or not guilty.

[00:24:51.265] As long as that violation is

[00:24:53.650] adjudicated with some form of guilt, that would then count towards.

[00:24:57.970] >> You're able to access all that as you move

[00:25:00.370] forward if you'd be the second or third or fourth time?

[00:25:02.665] >> Correct. Our officers have developed a very intense system of tracking these.

[00:25:07.315] I'm impressed as I go through.

[00:25:08.770] I actually went through it yesterday.

[00:25:10.240] Our Marine officers are very on top of this,

[00:25:12.370] very on top of the tracking.

[00:25:13.960] I've asked them specifically about where a vessel

[00:25:16.870] is in the process and they can tell me right off the pat.

[00:25:19.675] >> That's great. I do want to say thank you as well.

[00:25:22.255] This is very impressive.

[00:25:24.085] I'm pleased to see that you're on the legislature side as well.

[00:25:28.105] Great job. Thank you.

[00:25:31.860] >> Good evening, Chief. Been monitoring this for years,

[00:25:36.400] and I've always appreciate all the hard work you guys have put into this because I know

[00:25:39.220] it's an arduous task and get you guys out of what you need to do.

[00:25:44.610] Barnacle buses was a great idea.

[00:25:47.155] Who came up with that? That was fantastic.

[00:25:48.790] >> It was our Marine unit. [OVERLAPPING]. One in particular.

[00:25:52.480] >> Of the 9 vessels that some were cited and of the 9 that some left the area,

[00:26:02.875] and the ones that remained,

[00:26:04.240] did they clear just the propulsion system,

[00:26:07.930] or did they clear the whole haul?

[00:26:09.265] Did they haul the boat and they have a scraper go in there and clean the whole thing,

[00:26:14.080] or they just get in by with clean up the prop and the run?

[00:26:17.320] >> This was specifically tailored towards the propulsion system.

[00:26:20.560] In order to show that they rectified the problem that we cited them for,

[00:26:24.505] that was where we were focused on.

[00:26:27.330] >> Did they all look the same,

[00:26:29.515] were they all just gummed up with barnacles?

[00:26:32.035] >> A lot of them were similar to the photos they saw.

[00:26:34.885] >> Now, what about sailboats?

[00:26:37.030] Sailboats don't have to have running gear, correct,

[00:26:40.015] to make way legally in this situation?

[00:26:42.745] >> I know that they have to have that means of propulsion,

[00:26:45.160] which means that sail could act as that means of propulsion.

[00:26:48.295] To my knowledge, and Captain Banski,

[00:26:50.380] correct me if I'm wrong, none of these were sailboats.

[00:26:52.510] None of these that we're dealing with right now are sailboats.

[00:26:55.555] >> We've had sailboats in the past.

[00:26:57.055] We have the blue moon off of right inside the inlet there.

[00:27:01.110] I went by that many times in my boat,

[00:27:03.775] and his rigging was derelict.

[00:27:05.980] If he put his main sail up, it would tear.

[00:27:08.260] He didn't have propulsion, but he claimed that he did.

[00:27:10.675] Do we monitor that also?

[00:27:12.715] >> We look at all the vessels that come in,

[00:27:14.530] and you'll see on the quarterly report,

[00:27:15.910] there are some sail boats on there.

[00:27:18.750] I'll get with the Marine and make sure we're stand on top of those sail.

[00:27:22.030] >> I was just wondering if there's different criteria for means of propulsion, too, so.

[00:27:26.605] >> They're very vague in the statute.

[00:27:28.060] It just has to be a means of propulsion.

[00:27:29.635] If that sail works and it can push the boat.

[00:27:31.780] Again, that's a tougher one to test

[00:27:33.775] because you don't want to start it moving and then you can't stop.

[00:27:35.920] [LAUGHTER].

[00:27:37.570] With a 30 day if you get the license anchor for 30 days,

[00:27:42.295] but you can move anywhere within a mile,

[00:27:45.700] but it's to a different anchorage area,

[00:27:49.120] correct? Not just anywhere.

[00:27:50.470] >> No. According to the ordinance that we're allowed to create,

[00:27:54.220] they have not specified that yet.

[00:27:56.170] If we were to create that ordinance,

[00:27:58.600] it tells me they're allowed to basically go anywhere in the way it reads,

[00:28:03.130] it says anywhere in the county.

[00:28:05.440] There's a lot of work to do left on that bill, I think.

[00:28:08.830] [OVERLAPPING]. As far as I can tell,

[00:28:12.835] an ordinance would not prevent them from moving.

[00:28:15.280] >> Thank you. Appreciate it for great work.

[00:28:17.590] >> Just a couple of comments. Number 1,

[00:28:20.815] this has been a strategic initiative for a number of years,

[00:28:23.800] and I think how far we've come.

[00:28:26.800] From when we first included this,

[00:28:31.450] we really didn't know how we were going to proceed on it,

[00:28:34.120] but we had environmental concerns for the Blue moon and others.

[00:28:37.915] But what strikes me here in the keep takeaways is

[00:28:42.600] the police department has done just a phenomenal job and kudos to the team,

[00:28:49.540] and I just highlight, remains proactive.

[00:28:53.545] Under emphasizes, I think how extraordinary this is because I think it's commendable.

[00:29:00.250] The one thing proactive would be,

[00:29:02.140] we've got a kittens going and you see them and you take action on them.

[00:29:07.450] But this goes beyond that to stepping it

[00:29:11.500] up significantly with the brainstorming and then doing the barnacle busters.

[00:29:16.195] Then on top of that to be continually monitoring proposed legislation.

[00:29:22.570] We already were at a high level of performance in this one,

[00:29:26.650] but I think I'd be remiss not to emphasize, really,

[00:29:28.930] this is absolutely commendable and on behalf of all of our residents in the council,

[00:29:35.155] thank you very much of the team.

[00:29:36.985] >> Thank you.

[00:29:37.690] >> Thank you, Mayor. Appreciate it.

[00:29:44.130] >> Moving on to citizen comments.

[00:29:47.410] Do we have any citizen comments?

[00:29:48.700] >> No, sir.

[00:29:51.660] >> Moving on to the minutes.

[00:29:54.175] Counsel, we have before us,

[00:29:55.480] the minutes to the November 18th meeting.

[00:29:57.640] I didn't see any corrections on the dias.

[00:30:00.760] If there are none, I'd take a motion in a second to approve the minutes as submitted.

[00:30:04.840] >> I'll make a motion that we accept the minutes of November 18, 2025 as submitted.

[00:30:10.435] >> Second.

[00:30:11.620] >> Motion and second. All in favor signify by saying aye.

[00:30:14.965] >> Aye.

[00:30:15.865] >> Motion carries unanimously.

[00:30:18.235] Moving on to the consent agenda items.

[00:30:21.190] These are items 4 through 13.

[00:30:23.530] Was there any member of the public that wished to pull a consent agenda item?

[00:30:27.505] >> No, sir.

[00:30:28.630] >> Is there any member on the dias wishes to pull a consent agenda item?

[00:30:33.430] >> Yes. I like to pull item number 11,

[00:30:35.605] which is resolution 130 dias 25.

[00:30:38.500] >> Any others?

[00:30:40.075] >> To items.

[00:30:41.230] >> I pulled number 4 and number 12.

[00:30:47.080] I'll take a motion in a second approving

[00:30:50.710] the amended consent agenda consisted of items 5 through 10, and then number 13.

[00:30:57.565] >> Second.

[00:30:58.945] >> Motion is second. All in favor,

[00:31:00.610] signify by saying aye.

[00:31:01.975] >> Aye.

[00:31:03.265] >> Motion carries unanimously.

[00:31:07.140] On agenda item 4,

[00:31:09.850] this is as judicial.

[00:31:11.260] Does counsel have any ex parte disclosures?

[00:31:14.455] >> I spoke with staff.

[00:31:16.030] >> I just visited the site.

[00:31:21.475] I didn't had lunch there.

[00:31:24.360] >> I did talk with Planning and Zoning Director John Sickler,

[00:31:30.355] and I was asking for some staff suggested language that could be added to the resolution

[00:31:37.270] to prohibit future conversion of any parking spaces to

[00:31:40.300] restrict it in use to a privileged view.

[00:31:44.590] Since I pulled this one,

[00:31:46.945] I pulled it and in the past,

[00:31:50.950] I've had a number of conversations with Planning and Zoning.

[00:31:55.555] I see that an unintended consequence in my opinion,

[00:31:59.500] when you do allow a shared parking,

[00:32:01.150] which is not an entitlement,

[00:32:03.475] that sometimes the designation of spaces,

[00:32:09.430] limiting them to a privileged few,

[00:32:12.910] in my opinion, has gotten out of hand in certain shopping centers.

[00:32:19.030] I know I've worked with Mr. Sickler on one of them in particular,

[00:32:23.470] and I know he's been great on following up with

[00:32:27.850] the property owner to get those what seems to be ongoing violations resolved.

[00:32:34.015] But what happens is that I think a shopping center,

[00:32:38.440] every space should be available to everybody,

[00:32:40.840] short of the handicap one.

[00:32:42.100] So when you start seeing popping up signs, it says, No,

[00:32:45.445] this is only for this person or that per,

[00:32:47.590] this business or that business,

[00:32:49.870] it is allowed by the code.

[00:32:51.805] But I've concluded that I've seen so much of this in cases that I think is wrong,

[00:32:58.855] that I'm not inclined to ever approve

[00:33:03.100] shared parking without coming back to us.

[00:33:11.005] I'd asked John to give me a suggested language,

[00:33:16.555] which she was kind enough in doing,

[00:33:18.775] and if counsel were to agree with me,

[00:33:21.880] I would just add a provision and this was

[00:33:23.710] John's suggested language that would read under parking.

[00:33:28.630] Parking spaces shall not be reserved for use by

[00:33:32.140] a specific tenant or customers of a specific tenant within the plaza.

[00:33:36.805] We're granting shared use,

[00:33:39.145] which allows them to go ahead and change the uses in the Plaza without adding parking.

[00:33:44.005] But then this Plaza cornajine and I would think it's the case.

[00:33:48.550] There is no current instances of that happening.

[00:33:53.500] But I just don't want it to happen.

[00:33:55.330] So one condition for me to approve it would be, adding this condition.

[00:33:59.650] I don't know if counsel agrees or disagrees,

[00:34:02.080] but if there's an agreement, I'd like to add that.

[00:34:05.515] >> Would that be Town wide or just the specific?

[00:34:07.915] >> One of these has to be done specifically.

[00:34:10.030] >> Specifically, right.

[00:34:10.885] >> When you're acting upon a site plan,

[00:34:14.110] it would be one of the conditions.

[00:34:16.135] Right now, the resolution includes a condition.

[00:34:19.820] Allowing more intensive use that could only happen with shared parking.

[00:34:25.990] That would still stand.

[00:34:27.590] But in designating this,

[00:34:29.570] there would be this provision that parking spaces

[00:34:34.990] shall not be reserved for use by

[00:34:36.670] a specific tenant or customers of a specific tenant in the Plaza.

[00:34:40.295] >> I would agree with that.

[00:34:41.370] >> I have two questions for that.

[00:34:42.610] Can I get some examples of what you mean by restricted spaces?

[00:34:45.570] Is it like loading zones or what types of restrictions qualify?

[00:34:50.050] >> Well, a couple of shopping centers in particular that I've seen,

[00:34:53.490] one that I happened to go to.

[00:35:01.890] >> Plaza name, but it's escaped me right now,

[00:35:05.530] but nonetheless, it's in Abacoa and military.

[00:35:08.185] But like one I go to,

[00:35:12.370] I see six or eight signs that are

[00:35:17.590] limiting parking to its changed over time what it was defined as,

[00:35:23.530] to 15 minutes or three minutes or something.

[00:35:26.785] I've seen the uses change.

[00:35:28.840] I look at the uses there,

[00:35:30.520] and the uses don't warrant,

[00:35:35.410] in my mind, special parking spaces, every customer,

[00:35:38.635] and so what happens is these spaces don't get used.

[00:35:43.990] They sit vacant, or alternatively,

[00:35:46.660] people who are using them, no one's going to do anything about it,

[00:35:49.510] so I'm just going to park in it.

[00:35:51.025] But they're front spots and this happens to be one of the shopping centers.

[00:35:55.435] What is the number of medical offices?

[00:35:58.930] Somebody, not with a handicap tag, likewise,

[00:36:05.440] still can't use a front spot because the sign prohibits

[00:36:08.680] that or implies you're prohibited from using it.

[00:36:12.145] >> You have the 15-minute sign or

[00:36:14.530] on the curb that stops your tires is reserved for such and such,

[00:36:21.025] like two or three outside of a specific business.

[00:36:24.115] Don't park here unless you're coming in here.

[00:36:25.840] >> We also have COVID.

[00:36:27.010] The post-COVID stuff is still around with groceries,

[00:36:30.250] and in this case,

[00:36:33.610] this is specific to this; it's not.

[00:36:36.325] >> It's only this one.

[00:36:37.855] >> But you're suggesting that this be the case always.

[00:36:42.145] >> Well, first of all,

[00:36:43.675] we don't often get a request,

[00:36:46.420] how many new projects do we have that's that big that we could have?

[00:36:51.640] It's less likely now that the towns built out.

[00:36:54.880] Those that already have shared use already have shared use and come in,

[00:36:59.620] and staff can approve it.

[00:37:00.730] I'm not talking about a code change,

[00:37:02.440] but I'm just saying if we're going to add to the inventory of

[00:37:07.510] large centers that parking areas that have to allow them to do shared use.

[00:37:15.430] I'm okay with it when I see what it's for.

[00:37:18.745] But when you're depriving residents of using spots,

[00:37:24.225] that's where I disagree.

[00:37:25.800] In fact, I was going by one.

[00:37:27.150] I'd rather not reference business right now,

[00:37:29.160] but the other day, I was going by,

[00:37:31.170] and I saw these two spots.

[00:37:33.470] It is in an area that there's a lot of use of the parking.

[00:37:37.720] I went over there, and I took a snap a picture of it.

[00:37:41.560] The proprietor saw me taking a picture, came out,

[00:37:45.310] and said, but I didn't want to engage in the conversation.

[00:37:50.230] I was just taking a picture,

[00:37:51.400] but it's a proprietor who says,

[00:37:54.790] Well, they have some older customers that go there,

[00:37:58.390] and they want them to have an upfront spot.

[00:38:01.165] I haven't checked with staff yet,

[00:38:03.910] but I don't believe it was approved.

[00:38:05.815] But these things just appear.

[00:38:07.765] Well, everybody would want a front spa for their customers,

[00:38:11.170] but the whole point is, it's in a shopping center, it could be,

[00:38:13.840] it should be, whoever comes should be able to use the space.

[00:38:19.960] >> This outdoor seating is a holdover from COVID?

[00:38:23.020] >> This is an outdoor seating.

[00:38:24.205] This is not an outdoor seating area here.

[00:38:26.005] In this one, they're changing the use to include it says outdoor seating in here,

[00:38:31.030] but in addition, they're also changing the use,

[00:38:35.305] I think, to add more medical or something.

[00:38:37.570] I'd have to go back and look at [OVERLAPPING].

[00:38:42.370] Again, I'm okay with granting that shared parking,

[00:38:47.050] but not the unintended consequence that can happen,

[00:38:51.850] and then those are difficult to investigate and code enforcement.

[00:38:58.195] >> I agree.

[00:38:58.975] >> Just a question, Jim, sorry.

[00:39:02.650] Mayor, how would we know when a landlord has leased out

[00:39:10.480] a particular segment in a property and

[00:39:14.530] has given the tenant two spaces in front or three spaces,

[00:39:18.640] as we know some of the smaller plazas,

[00:39:21.760] so where do we cut it off from a larger parking to a smaller?

[00:39:27.535] >> First of all, if somebody has shared parking,

[00:39:32.530] approved, then staff actually does, you know,

[00:39:36.280] our planning and zoning department staff manages that.

[00:39:40.525] >>They would have to monitor.

[00:39:41.830] >> They would have to come in.

[00:39:43.135] It's not practical, really, to monitor it.

[00:39:45.400] But if it was brought to their attention and they hadn't approved it,

[00:39:50.950] they can reject it,

[00:39:52.615] and then the signs have to be pulled down.

[00:39:55.650] But there are a few centers. I tell you what.

[00:39:58.330] In my mind, it's because once they

[00:40:00.430] realize it's happening and they're getting away with it,

[00:40:03.025] you start seeing a whole bunch.

[00:40:04.660] >> Sometimes they use the temporary signs also.

[00:40:07.465] >> I'm okay with that on a case-by-case basis.

[00:40:10.040] I know Abacoa is the baseball parking,

[00:40:11.935] it's all tiered, there could be use changes there in downtown. I could see a pickup.

[00:40:17.620] >> This is not downtown.

[00:40:19.150] >> The one that military trail.

[00:40:21.460] >> The military rail,

[00:40:22.630] but it's one that has a lot of medical uses.

[00:40:25.600] >> I think we've all seen that.

[00:40:27.190] I think it's inconvenient.

[00:40:29.005] I'm supportive on a case-by-case basis,

[00:40:31.030] and this being one. That's fine.

[00:40:34.590] >> I'll take a motion in a second with adding this condition, please.

[00:40:39.550] >> Motion with the addition of the mayor's condition?

[00:40:41.800] >> Second.

[00:40:42.745] >> Motion a second. All in favor,

[00:40:44.410] signify by saying aye.

[00:40:45.865] >> Aye. [OVERLAPPING]

[00:40:47.680] >> Motion carries unanimously.

[00:40:50.490] Moving on to Item 11 pulled by Councilor.

[00:40:54.910] >> May I still have one more question on Number 4?

[00:40:59.110] Just a question on the lighting and when they fail, who's monitoring this?

[00:41:07.390] This sounds like, in this particular case, it's ongoing.

[00:41:12.205] Who goes around and does these inspections?

[00:41:15.955] Are they on an honor system?

[00:41:17.965] If they're on an honor system,

[00:41:19.480] the lights wouldn't be failing.

[00:41:26.910] >> For the condition, excuse me,

[00:41:29.470] John Sickler, for the record, planning and zoning.

[00:41:32.425] The owner is going to be responsible for

[00:41:35.440] maintaining records and doing monthly inspections.

[00:41:38.260] They're required to provide the town with a report annually of that,

[00:41:42.610] but we can also request or do an inspection at any time to check the purposes.

[00:41:50.500] the lights have been many lights out at that plaza.

[00:41:54.670] They have lighting, you may be familiar with,

[00:41:56.965] that outlines the perimeter edge of the coping of the building or the parapet walls.

[00:42:04.350] Excuse me, that's just been a persistent issue,

[00:42:08.080] so the Planning Commission, in particular,

[00:42:11.125] had asked that some of these issues be dealt with a little bit more deliberately,

[00:42:15.010] and that we set a standard,

[00:42:16.450] and that's when we established the more deliberate inspection process and record keeping.

[00:42:21.985] >> Makes sense. Thank you. Appreciate that.

[00:42:27.120] >> Moving on to agenda Item 11, Counsel Guisinger.

[00:42:32.545] >> I asked this jet item to be pulled.

[00:42:36.175] I'd like to make a revision to it.

[00:42:38.500] Staff worked on this revision for me the last couple of days,

[00:42:41.110] and you should have a copy of it on the dias with you.

[00:42:44.515] But primarily, it was when the presentation was made on November 6,

[00:42:48.745] part of that presentation was requesting town support for

[00:42:52.900] Jupiter Narrows Conservation Alliance efforts to name

[00:42:55.870] the Mangrove Island in Honor of Andrew Reed Harris.

[00:42:59.455] That specific statement was missing from the resolution.

[00:43:04.300] You have an amended copy here.

[00:43:07.270] I'd like to make a motion to amend that resolution as follows.

[00:43:11.545] One is really minor; we combined Paragraphs 4 and 5

[00:43:14.980] of the resolution because they are pretty much the same.

[00:43:18.250] We added the sixth paragraph or the last paragraph,

[00:43:20.890] which reads, whereas the town council, excuse me,

[00:43:23.590] the town council of the town of Jupiter supports the JCNA efforts to officially name the

[00:43:27.385] up Narrows Mango violence in honor of Andrew Reed Harris.

[00:43:31.960] >> I second.

[00:43:34.030] >> That is consistent with what I recollect.

[00:43:37.150] Thank you for getting that incorporated.

[00:43:39.880] >> Thank you to the staff for working out in

[00:43:41.350] the last couple of days and making that change for me.

[00:43:43.075] I appreciate it particularly that John Sickler was involved with it. I appreciate it.

[00:43:49.170] >> I don't remember. Did you make a motion?

[00:43:51.730] >> I made a motion and a second.

[00:43:54.025] >> Motion a second. All in favor.

[00:43:55.780] Signify by saying aye.

[00:43:57.160] >> Aye.

[00:43:58.240] >> Motion carries unanimously.

[00:44:01.495] Moving on to Item 12,

[00:44:05.740] the last item pulled from consent.

[00:44:08.050] I pulled this item.

[00:44:11.190] I pulled this one, and I've had some history on this particular item here,

[00:44:17.890] but I pulled this one because I'm just concerned about allowing for one-year renewals.

[00:44:26.370] Staff went out and came back with a contract,

[00:44:32.365] and for a one-year term,

[00:44:34.150] we need to have a contract,

[00:44:35.320] so at this point in time, I'll support that,

[00:44:37.600] but I don't support the one-year renewals, the four of them.

[00:44:41.860] The reason I don't, I'll say,

[00:44:43.345] is that, in May,

[00:44:46.345] we had this bid,

[00:44:49.235] and there were six bidders.

[00:44:52.185] Now there are three.

[00:44:53.865] The apparent low bidder from that May bidding didn't submit a bid now,

[00:45:00.640] which I think was predictable to me.

[00:45:03.610] Further, the low bidder increased their bid 30% since May.

[00:45:13.015] I did talk to the staff of that 30% increase,

[00:45:18.415] 13 and a half percent was due to a scope increase.

[00:45:21.760] They added an allowance for schools out camps days.

[00:45:29.900] But there was a 16.5% cost increase.

[00:45:35.550] When this was bid in May,

[00:45:37.740] the low bidder at that time was 15% lower.

[00:45:43.625] Realizing that the bids,

[00:45:45.985] we've got the number of bidders went down from 6-3,

[00:45:51.090] and the low bidder before didn't submit a bid,

[00:45:56.970] and I'm confident that with the new procurement manager that

[00:46:02.020] our reputation for seeking competitive proposals will improve.

[00:46:08.035] I want that opportunity after one year use to come back and see what what the market has.

[00:46:16.750] But again, my concern is just that this is basically

[00:46:22.765] 30% higher than we had another bidder for just six months ago on, same scope basis.

[00:46:29.515] An event, so it's up to the council,

[00:46:31.780] but so I would.

[00:46:33.805] I'm supportive of the contract,

[00:46:35.650] but not making it very clear that I don't want to allow each year for us to

[00:46:40.300] do the one-year renewal because I think I'd like to see it we bid again.

[00:46:45.415] >> Is there any benefit to seeing a one-year renewal in a multi-year renewal?

[00:46:49.915] >> Well, we always put the renewal feature in there if you're satisfied,

[00:46:54.880] if you feel you have competitive pricing,

[00:46:57.715] and you're satisfied with the vendor.

[00:46:59.440] There's a cost to bid.

[00:47:02.070] >> But we're not getting any break for giving options for

[00:47:06.145] renewal on the contract? The town.

[00:47:09.460] >> Do we have the option to renew each year?

[00:47:12.820] >> We have the option.

[00:47:14.245] >> Could I actually ask staff to come up and speak to this?

[00:47:16.780] Because I know in the past, we've had

[00:47:18.010] some emergency situations with transportation for summer camp.

[00:47:22.270] There may be a benefit.

[00:47:24.310] >> Mike Haufman, Community Services.

[00:47:26.710] Good evening, Mayor, Council members.

[00:47:28.660] The idea of the one-year renewal was to actually get out of a contract in

[00:47:33.070] case they couldn't meet the standard and services of having the bus services,

[00:47:37.480] which we've had experiences with in the past so that was the idea and the intent of it,

[00:47:42.115] and I understand the mayor's concerns, but,

[00:47:45.415] if they were not able to meet those standards,

[00:47:48.460] we were able to exit the contract.

[00:47:52.140] >> I think in the past, there was a problem with meeting the standard, not just cost.

[00:47:57.820] We can get out of it.

[00:48:00.025] If we think it's a good idea to rebid for cost purposes or for performance purposes.

[00:48:08.850] >> That's a good question.

[00:48:11.110] Could it be either or cost performance?

[00:48:13.930] >> Correct.

[00:48:14.875] >> Do we have to give them a certain amount of time that it's going to be performing?

[00:48:20.520] >> It's just through one year.

[00:48:22.930] We just evaluate throughout the year.

[00:48:28.630] >> What if six months in,

[00:48:30.070] they're just dropping the ball and it's not working out,

[00:48:32.755] we have the right to terminate the contract? Move on?

[00:48:35.575] >> I would need to. Yes.

[00:48:39.690] >> Bidder, my understanding,

[00:48:42.130] the bidder that's being awarded the contract,

[00:48:44.125] we've used for years,

[00:48:45.640] so it's unlikely to have performance issues.

[00:48:48.550] On a bidder you've used for years.

[00:48:54.780] It comes down to the cost.

[00:48:59.940] I'll take a motion in a second.

[00:49:02.335] However, Council wishes to do it.

[00:49:06.720] >> Well, I'll make a motion that we just accept the one-year term.

[00:49:15.240] >> Second.

[00:49:16.675] >> Second.

[00:49:18.060] >> Is that a second?

[00:49:20.155] >> Second.

[00:49:21.940] >> Any discussion?

[00:49:24.340] >> No.

[00:49:25.495] >> Take a motion, we have a motion a second to proceed with a one-year contract term.

[00:49:31.915] All in favor signify by saying aye.

[00:49:34.135] >> Aye.

[00:49:34.915] >> Any opposed? Motion carries unanimously. Thank you.

[00:49:41.490] Moving on to the regular agenda item, resolution 8625.

[00:49:53.340] This is a regular agenda item.

[00:49:56.290] I think the staff has a presentation.

[00:50:25.850] >> Good evening, Mayor and town council.

[00:50:28.485] Amanda Barnes, Director of Utilities.

[00:50:30.525] Tonight, I'll be presenting to you a contract to replace

[00:50:34.830] our existing water metering system with

[00:50:37.290] a newer technology known as advanced metering infrastructure.

[00:50:45.860] During this presentation, I will explain why this project is necessary,

[00:50:51.330] provide you a review of our existing metering system,

[00:50:54.480] an explanation of what the proposed metering system,

[00:50:57.705] how the proposed metering system will benefit the town and our customers.

[00:51:01.830] Scott Reynolds, our finance director,

[00:51:03.840] will discuss the request for proposals and the proposed funding option for the contract.

[00:51:09.615] Then I'll close in providing public education and training and key takeaways.

[00:51:18.860] The town's water system covers a service area of approximately 58 square miles,

[00:51:24.465] extending through the town's municipal boundary through the town of

[00:51:28.620] Juno Beach and into unincorporated areas of Martin and Palm Beach Counties.

[00:51:33.540] Currently, our water metering system includes

[00:51:36.360] 31,243 residential and non-residential meters.

[00:51:41.430] The purpose of this project is to replace the existing water metering system that is

[00:51:46.380] at the end of its 20-year useful life with a new metering system,

[00:51:50.955] that is newer technology that will address existing metering deficiencies,

[00:51:58.170] improve operational efficiencies, and enhance customer service features.

[00:52:03.105] The proposed contract includes

[00:52:05.400] a two-year construction implementation contract with

[00:52:08.280] Core & Main to furnish and install the new metering system.

[00:52:12.540] It also includes a Software as a Service and Spectrum Lease Agreement with Sensus,

[00:52:20.640] which consists of a 10-year initial term,

[00:52:23.340] followed by an automatic 10-year renewal for

[00:52:26.580] a total 20-year contract term for the software and network lease.

[00:52:31.440] The proposed Sensus meters are warrantied for 20 years.

[00:52:35.490] As such, the supporting software and network also need to

[00:52:39.360] be in place for the 20-year life of the meters.

[00:52:48.560] Our request for proposal included the requirement for the respondents to

[00:52:54.450] include the 20-year cost for the software and

[00:52:59.340] the network subscription fees for the purpose of us to avoid

[00:53:05.160] large subscription fee increases in

[00:53:07.980] the future and also to assist with future operational budgeting.

[00:53:12.360] We do know what those subscription fees will be for the 20-year term of the contract.

[00:53:24.560] The installation of the existing metering system began in 2006.

[00:53:33.300] Next year in 2026,

[00:53:35.520] parts of the system have reached 20 years of service.

[00:53:39.510] The existing system is referred to as an automatic reading system or an AMR system.

[00:53:45.735] Customer water usage data is collected once a month by

[00:53:49.230] utility field service representatives who drive

[00:53:52.545] by the meters in vehicles equipped with mobile data receivers.

[00:53:57.375] The collected meter readings are downloaded into a database when the

[00:54:01.200] utility field representative returns to the office at the end of the day.

[00:54:05.250] Monthly meter readings are then used to generate

[00:54:08.190] the monthly water bills by customer service staff.

[00:54:11.415] Before AMR was implemented in the town,

[00:54:14.730] meters were read manually.

[00:54:17.235] Ninety-nine percent of the existing meters,

[00:54:20.565] or approximately 31,000 of the existing meters,

[00:54:24.450] are what we consider small meters.

[00:54:26.280] They're two inches in diameter and smaller,

[00:54:31.095] mostly one-inch and three-quarter-inch meters.

[00:54:35.840] Those meters are approaching at or very near to their 20-year useful life.

[00:54:42.645] The existing small meters have internal mechanical parts that wear with use,

[00:54:49.830] and nearly half of our existing small meters have failed over the past five years.

[00:54:58.230] They continue to fail at the rate of about 450-500 a month.

[00:55:03.615] Our staff has incurred overtime,

[00:55:07.355] put in extra effort during the workday to keep up with

[00:55:10.925] the failing mechanisms on the existing meters,

[00:55:16.260] and it has become a burden on staff to operate and maintain the existing system.

[00:55:22.815] Accuracy testing was conducted on a sampling of existing small meters,

[00:55:28.285] and that testing indicates that once

[00:55:31.370] the meters have been in service for more than 15 years,

[00:55:34.895] they are 7.3% less accurate than if they were less than 10-years-old.

[00:55:43.955] This translates to a missed revenue of about $1.3 million a year.

[00:55:53.115] The reduction in accuracy is a result of

[00:55:56.550] the wear of the internal components that actually measure the flow,

[00:56:01.245] so 94% of the town's small meters are greater than 10-years-old, currently.

[00:56:09.740] Only 1% or 316 of the existing meters in our system are considered large meters,

[00:56:17.295] greater than two inches in diameter.

[00:56:19.425] The majority of those are ultrasonic,

[00:56:23.310] so they do not have internal moving parts.

[00:56:26.040] There are a few older meters on fire lines that haven't been used because we haven't,

[00:56:32.910] thankfully, had any fires in those locations.

[00:56:36.510] Those would be proposed to be replaced under this contract.

[00:56:41.190] The existing large meters,

[00:56:42.780] we're proposing instead of replacing them if they're 10 years or younger

[00:56:47.940] to just retrofit their data transmitters.

[00:56:54.165] The existing AMR system has reached the end of its 20-year useful life.

[00:56:59.520] Due to the high number of register failures,

[00:57:01.935] it has become a heavy burden for staff to operate and

[00:57:04.350] maintain while also fulfilling other necessary responsibilities.

[00:57:09.645] AMR has become an outdated technology.

[00:57:13.785] The proposed metering system,

[00:57:16.170] known as advanced metering infrastructure or AMI is

[00:57:20.145] a comprehensive smart metering system that transmits near

[00:57:24.015] real-time data over a secure communications network.

[00:57:29.085] Why should we consider transitioning to AMI for our water meter reading purposes?

[00:57:35.760] In addition to resolving the failures and

[00:57:37.980] challenges that I described with the previous slide,

[00:57:41.145] as a newer technology,

[00:57:42.705] AMI will provide the town and our water customers with benefits that

[00:57:46.020] the existing system is not capable of and opportunities for future enhancements.

[00:57:51.285] AMI provides daily reads,

[00:57:53.445] enabling customer service staff to provide

[00:57:55.560] faster response and better service to customer inquiries,

[00:57:58.950] whereas the existing system only provided monthly data.

[00:58:03.105] By transmitting meter readings on a daily basis,

[00:58:06.825] AMI will also supply customers, service staff,

[00:58:09.990] and water customers with the ability to detect trends in unusually high water use,

[00:58:15.795] which can aid in early detection of leaks,

[00:58:18.165] avoiding high water bills,

[00:58:19.470] and possible costly repairs resulting from undetected leaks.

[00:58:24.075] The Sensus meters to be installed under

[00:58:26.460] the proposed contract have no internal moving parts,

[00:58:29.520] and they are guaranteed for accuracy for 20 years.

[00:58:34.460] Sensus' network and metering equipment is proven

[00:58:38.250] reliable and is in use by neighboring utilities such as Tequesta,

[00:58:42.525] Seacoast, Palm Beach County,

[00:58:44.700] Miami Dade, and many others across South Florida and the nation.

[00:58:49.800] Core & Main is able to fully transition Jupiter's water system to Sensus AMI,

[00:58:57.030] utilizing existing town infrastructure, i.e, towers.

[00:59:01.650] No new towers will need to be constructed for Sensus to convert our system to AMI,

[00:59:10.545] whereas the other respondent proposals did require additional towers to be constructed.

[00:59:16.950] Sensus also does not require the use of commercial cellular service for their system.

[00:59:24.345] They own and operate the network on which communication will occur.

[00:59:30.000] The Sensus AMI system will provide the town's water customers

[00:59:34.200] with access to their daily usage through a customer portal,

[00:59:38.580] can be accessed on a computer or a smartphone application.

[00:59:43.860] Customers will be able to set thresholds for

[00:59:46.230] high bill alerts and access information to better

[00:59:48.870] understand their water use trends and control their use of water through conservation.

[00:59:54.710] Finally, AMI will provide utility field representatives with

[00:59:58.830] opportunities to perform proactive and improve system maintenance,

[01:00:02.910] which is very challenging now,

[01:00:04.875] considering the failures that we've had.

[01:00:08.250] They'll still be able to take care of

[01:00:10.695] their required customer service field tasks, meeting with residents,

[01:00:15.000] assisting with field notifications,

[01:00:17.915] and then also providing needed support for other distribution system maintenance needs.

[01:00:24.950] This slide just provides a simple illustration of how data will be transmitted over

[01:00:31.350] an AMI system where the smart meters located at the homes collect.

[01:00:38.160] There's an antenna box that will be installed next to the existing meter box.

[01:00:43.050] That antenna will transmit the data securely to existing towers,

[01:00:48.300] which will then transmit the data to the software database and customer service,

[01:00:53.550] and customers will then have access to that data.

[01:00:59.150] Scott Reynolds will now come up and present financing.

[01:01:07.100] >> Good evening. Scott Reynolds, I'm the finance director for the town of Jupiter.

[01:01:13.190] We talked about this project during the budget process this summer.

[01:01:20.640] In fact, I think it was Councilor Guisinger who

[01:01:23.730] led the charge on that initially to talk about return on

[01:01:27.060] investment and those type of discussions

[01:01:30.150] surrounding the large capital investment of replacing all the meters.

[01:01:34.700] Amanda and her staff,

[01:01:37.035] they had went out to bid.

[01:01:38.715] They requested proposals and they received three proposals,

[01:01:42.690] and then were evaluated by their staff,

[01:01:45.990] and the selection committee selected and ranked

[01:01:49.050] Core & Main based on the proposal rankings.

[01:01:52.980] They went back and they negotiated,

[01:01:55.140] as Amanda and her team do,

[01:01:58.065] try to get the best price for their payers.

[01:02:00.390] They will negotiate a contract, and that's what they did.

[01:02:03.570] They went back and they negotiated a lower price based on the bid,

[01:02:06.900] savings of just over $5.5 million,

[01:02:09.765] almost $5.6 million less than what was bid.

[01:02:13.860] That was based primarily on a shorter implementation time.

[01:02:18.900] I have to give it to Amanda and her team,

[01:02:21.270] they're looking for a quick rate of return.

[01:02:26.325] This leads back to some of the discussions we had over the summer

[01:02:29.430] about revenue being unrecognized or

[01:02:34.350] being lost due to the mechanics of the current legacy meters that are in the ground.

[01:02:42.105] The mechanics and the meters,

[01:02:44.310] they wear down over time.

[01:02:45.630] They always fall in the customer's favor as far as

[01:02:48.195] registering less revenue or less water going through the meter.

[01:02:57.020] Get to the next slide.

[01:02:59.985] What they've estimated is about $1.3 million

[01:03:02.985] in unrecognized revenue annually going forward.

[01:03:08.270] Time is of the essence to try to replace these meters with something more accurate.

[01:03:13.650] The mechanics of the new meters that are being recommended, they're not there.

[01:03:19.230] There is a 20-year guarantee on these meters,

[01:03:22.335] which is very important,

[01:03:23.760] comes into why are we requesting a 20-year contract?

[01:03:30.120] Well, that coincides with the lifespan of

[01:03:32.700] the meters that we're talking about placing in the ground.

[01:03:35.865] If you can just do quick math,

[01:03:38.625] $1.3 million over 11-year period,

[01:03:43.155] it's already paid for what we're requesting from

[01:03:46.770] capital investment and some operating costs of just over $14 million.

[01:03:51.030] We will have to advance some money in the CIP to help pay for this,

[01:03:57.090] but we've also went back and looked at carry forward dollars.

[01:04:03.600] I know we heard that loud and clear from the council.

[01:04:06.780] They wanted us to look for

[01:04:09.345] sunsetting projects that were coming at the end of the fiscal year,

[01:04:13.140] so we did some of that.

[01:04:14.625] We got some savings of about $2.2 million in FY '25 carry-forward money to help pay for

[01:04:20.790] this along with $3.7 million in

[01:04:23.880] the large and small meter carry-forward dollars to help pay for it.

[01:04:28.320] We have $14.3 million available outside of the pushing forward,

[01:04:37.455] about 8.3 million from

[01:04:40.380] the large and small meter future dollars that were

[01:04:43.140] being requested to come from R&R funding.

[01:04:46.785] But just wanted to make sure that the council

[01:04:50.850] was aware of how we're requesting to fund this large endeavor,

[01:04:54.810] and then also the good job by the utility staff in negotiating

[01:04:58.455] a savings to the repayer for the implementation of the project.

[01:05:03.780] Now, we will have to continue to spend

[01:05:07.050] some operating dollars after the implementation every year for the 20 years.

[01:05:12.270] But at the end of the 20 years,

[01:05:13.350] we'll be going back out to bid again,

[01:05:15.315] but we will have a total savings.

[01:05:18.615] The last nine years,

[01:05:20.625] if you still hold true of the $1.3 million in revenue reductions,

[01:05:25.305] which that number only grows, that's today's dollars.

[01:05:28.410] Going forward, those dollars would increase.

[01:05:32.115] But if you just use that,

[01:05:34.095] you're saving an additional $11.7 million on

[01:05:37.560] those last nine years of service life of those meters.

[01:05:42.525] With that, I'll turn it back over to Amanda,

[01:05:44.670] unless there's some specific questions you have for me.

[01:05:57.840] >> Thank you, Scott. The utilities and community relations Departments

[01:06:03.460] will collaborate with Core & Main team to develop an outreach program to

[01:06:06.730] inform and educate our water customers regarding implementation of

[01:06:10.510] the new metering system and how it will impact them and what we need from them.

[01:06:15.355] One of the things that will be needed from customers is for them

[01:06:19.510] to make sure that we have a three foot clear space around the meter box,

[01:06:23.515] which that is a town standard and it's a standard in our construction,

[01:06:28.660] guidelines and contracts right now.

[01:06:31.885] So it's not anything new,

[01:06:34.315] but we will be sending out notices to residents,

[01:06:37.030] asking them to review the area around their meter box and remove

[01:06:40.570] anything that they would like to keep if there's landscaping, they want to relocate.

[01:06:44.260] They can go ahead and do that or any personal items.

[01:06:46.510] They can remove those,

[01:06:48.100] and it will also give us an opportunity

[01:06:51.250] to meet with the resident and communicate about the project.

[01:06:56.875] The methods that we'll use to reach residents will include mail,

[01:07:02.500] door cards, Bill inserts,

[01:07:04.015] the website, email blast, social media posts.

[01:07:06.970] Then, of course, we're always available for in person meetings and phone calls.

[01:07:14.100] Our community relations director also has experience with implementing an AMI system and

[01:07:22.135] messaging or providing outreach communication to residents at a previous employment.

[01:07:30.655] He's well versed in doing this and he said he's willing to help us with that.

[01:07:36.775] Then finally, town staff will also receive training from

[01:07:40.300] Core & Main and Census on the use of the new system.

[01:07:43.645] Census will be responsible for operation and maintenance of the software and the network.

[01:07:49.810] The town will not have to provide staff for that.

[01:07:54.660] Just some key takeaways.

[01:07:57.265] The AMI system that is proposed in the contract before you is proven technology.

[01:08:02.110] It is successfully being utilized by neighboring utilities.

[01:08:08.690] The town's response to customer service will be improved with this new system,

[01:08:13.830] and customers will have access to their water use,

[01:08:16.500] will they will be able to identify areas for water conservation and

[01:08:22.350] also get early detection of leaks and hopefully save money in the long run,

[01:08:29.740] not having to wait till the water bill comes to realize that they had

[01:08:33.220] a high water bill and had a leak that caused damage that they weren't aware of.

[01:08:37.930] The AMI system in the contract before you offers the best warranty in the industry,

[01:08:43.240] guaranteeing metering accuracy for 20 years.

[01:08:47.425] There are batteries with these meters.

[01:08:50.440] The battery life is also one of the best in the industries,

[01:08:53.500] 15 years, full warranty on the batteries five year pro rated warranty.

[01:08:57.835] The MI system propose makes use of existing town infrastructure,

[01:09:03.460] [LAUGHTER] which is a relief to me that no new towers need to be constructed.

[01:09:11.140] I remember what the police Department had to go through to get the tower constructed.

[01:09:16.960] And then Core & Main is able to fully transition the town system in a two year period,

[01:09:24.460] which would be helpful in many ways because

[01:09:28.510] of the existing condition of the existing metering system.

[01:09:33.100] Census also has the ability to provide

[01:09:35.920] redundant backup networks because they do service the neighboring utilities.

[01:09:40.660] In the event of a storm, for some reason,

[01:09:42.670] one of our antenna towers goes out,

[01:09:44.755] they have redundant backup to the north and to the south of us.

[01:09:49.465] Consideration in our decision was given to retrofitting our existing system,

[01:09:57.550] but based on the overwhelming number of failures that

[01:10:01.120] we've had and that continue to occur,

[01:10:04.555] the reduced accuracy of the meters that is occurring and the age of the existing system.

[01:10:13.860] It's my opinion that it's not in our best interest to

[01:10:17.680] retrofit or try to put a band aid on the existing system.

[01:10:21.550] It's old technology and it should be replaced.

[01:10:25.690] With that, I will take any questions that you might have.

[01:10:30.175] >> Any questions? Counsel Geiger?

[01:10:33.115] >> Yeah, I got a few. For the towers,

[01:10:37.225] Will they get a special antenna or

[01:10:39.160] a base station or something like that for transmitting.

[01:10:41.575] >> Yeah. There will be antennas and base stations placed in the locations.

[01:10:48.100] I do have representatives from Core & Main and [inaudible].

[01:10:51.040] >> Let me start with the box in the ground first with the meter.

[01:10:54.145] Will I have an antenna inside of it then for transmitting to a base station at Tower?

[01:10:58.390] >> It'll look like a dome inside.

[01:11:02.350] So we'll be putting a circular.

[01:11:04.870] Let me go back to this slide.

[01:11:06.820] It might be hard to see,

[01:11:08.740] but in the picture next to the house on that slide,

[01:11:12.685] you'll see the meter box and next to it is a circular box,

[01:11:15.925] like an irrigation system box.

[01:11:18.850] >> Correct.

[01:11:19.225] >> The antenna will be located in the in that.

[01:11:22.615] >> So that'll be above ground or will be covered by the little current water box.

[01:11:29.370] >> It'll be set on the meter the lid.

[01:11:33.460] >> Okay.

[01:11:34.465] >> Yeah.

[01:11:34.720] [inaudible]

[01:11:35.652] [BACKGROUND]

[01:11:46.840] >> That was my question.

[01:11:47.710] >> State your name.

[01:11:50.520] >> Good evening. I'm Dwyane Self.

[01:11:53.200] I'm the regional initiative manager for Core in Maine for the AMI Smart Meter initiative.

[01:11:58.660] Appreciate the opportunity to talk about it.

[01:12:01.135] The antenna itself at the meter box,

[01:12:04.510] think of it as a mushroom type looking little device that she described earlier,

[01:12:13.840] and it's about an eighth of an inch thick as far as what would be above.

[01:12:20.350] We can get that in

[01:12:22.600] a recess type lid as well so that it basically sits flush with the lid. There's no

[01:12:28.330] >> So no issue about Mowers running a [OVERLAPPING]

[01:12:32.980] >> Not as long as they're not [OVERLAPPING] scalping I'll say scalping the yard,

[01:12:40.110] piling up dirt with it or something like that.

[01:12:43.120] It's generally not a problem.

[01:12:44.680] It can be replaced as well.

[01:12:46.390] It's a separate piece from the meter so you can replace the housing.

[01:12:52.075] >> When I get to the tower,

[01:12:53.350] is that like some type of just an antenna or a base station,

[01:12:56.410] some type of equipment that gets mounted the tower.

[01:12:59.200] >> In each tower, there is a base station that goes there.

[01:13:03.385] It's a small box that's

[01:13:05.530] about maybe the side a little bit smaller than a college refrigerator.

[01:13:09.190] It's a small little box that sets

[01:13:12.625] down low on the grounds for easy maintenance and access.

[01:13:16.450] There's a coax cable goes up the tower or water tank or whatever we're attaching it to,

[01:13:22.630] and we put a fiberglass standard ampinol antenna

[01:13:27.340] similar to what cell phone companies use,

[01:13:29.170] that kind of thing to transmit down to it.

[01:13:31.465] >> I know you mentioned the meter,

[01:13:33.100] but does the antenna and the base station all have the same 20 year warranty?

[01:13:37.105] >> We're doing network as a service on this particular project,

[01:13:41.620] which what that means is it's similar to

[01:13:43.510] a cellular plan where the infrastructure is on me.

[01:13:47.260] If it fails, that's not the city's problem.

[01:13:50.005] It's my problem. We'll come in and fix the base stations and antennas and that stuff.

[01:13:54.235] You're only concerned about

[01:13:56.830] the radio transmitter at the house and the meter at the house,

[01:14:01.510] and those are the 20 year warranted items.

[01:14:04.315] >> Then the base stations covered by the annual fee repaying of

[01:14:08.200] 355825 [OVERLAPPING] Another question.

[01:14:14.380] How long is the RNR?

[01:14:16.240] What will take the RNR meter at a given residence?

[01:14:20.005] RNR. Take off the existing meter and put in the.

[01:14:24.040] I'm sorry. Remove and replace.

[01:14:27.145] >> It depends, but it's a very short process.

[01:14:30.850] I would say 10-15 minutes if we don't run into any random issues that will pop up.

[01:14:39.670] Sometimes it's an access issue getting to it or

[01:14:42.700] locating it or if we get there and discover a leak or something.

[01:14:47.020] But in general, let's call it 10 or 15 minutes.

[01:14:49.390] >> I'm just wondering how long the customer be with

[01:14:51.190] disrupting the water you see so. It's very minimal.

[01:14:54.220] >> It's very minimal we do have a process in place.

[01:14:57.130] Typically, when we go to change out a meter, we look at it,

[01:15:00.160] see if it's the meter that's there is currently being utilized.

[01:15:04.030] We'll go generally knock on the door.

[01:15:07.510] Try to make sure if there's a resident there,

[01:15:09.580] they're aware that they're going to be out of water for some period of time.

[01:15:12.265] For businesses, we will be contacting those businesses,

[01:15:17.725] and a lot of times we'll do some of those after hours,

[01:15:21.250] if it's a restaurant or something,

[01:15:22.390] we don't want to shut them down or something like that.

[01:15:24.670] We'll just try to pick a time

[01:15:26.790] that they're either closed or it's a weekend that they're not open,

[01:15:30.900] if it's a hair salon shop or something like that,

[01:15:33.390] we'll work with those customers.

[01:15:34.860] >> The AMI meters provided by Sensus,

[01:15:36.780] they are ultrasonic and not electromagnetic.

[01:15:40.400] >> They are electromagnetic on the small meters?

[01:15:45.175] >> That's why I want to ask because they've got

[01:15:46.510] better accuracy for the small meters, so. Okay.

[01:15:48.820] >> Correct.

[01:15:51.600] >> Director Barne you mentioned that customers

[01:15:55.810] only get US mail and they want to have a scheduling conflict,

[01:15:59.320] how can they then coordinate with the town or

[01:16:02.590] with the supplier here a schedule for when they want to [OVERLAPPING]

[01:16:08.190] >> You mean if they only get US mail?

[01:16:09.945] >> Yeah. They may not get texts and [OVERLAPPING]

[01:16:12.120] >> We will have phone numbers in the letter that for them to contact us, yes.

[01:16:17.625] >> In my last question. I appreciate the Math you guys did as far as identifying the

[01:16:22.740] 1.3 million per year in missed revenue and also the return on investment of,

[01:16:28.385] I think you said 11 years.

[01:16:29.800] That's great. One question on the 1.3 million missed revenue,

[01:16:34.525] that will now be realized.

[01:16:36.130] That means, what is

[01:16:38.710] the expectation to the customer relative to an increase in our water bill?

[01:16:42.490] >> I did look into that this afternoon.

[01:16:46.150] Our average user is a 10,000 gallon a month consumption use.

[01:16:53.715] Applying the 7.3% increase that we expect to see in accuracy,

[01:17:03.550] and based on our current water rates,

[01:17:06.940] I calculated $2.08 a month increase. Maybe.

[01:17:13.240] >> Yeah. I looked at the 1.3 by across the 31,000 meters like $41 a year,

[01:17:20.230] so that seems more realistic based on the usage. I appreciate.

[01:17:23.485] >> It depends how large of a consumer.

[01:17:25.930] We're in a conservation based rate structure.

[01:17:29.365] The more water you use, the higher the rate is.

[01:17:31.945] It could encourage conservation for sure.

[01:17:36.130] >> There's an app that the homeowner will have.

[01:17:38.500] He can look at his water usage,

[01:17:39.850] look what time of day is the most used

[01:17:42.340] and a little more conservative like to be conservation.

[01:17:47.520] Thank you. Appreciate it. I have no other questions.

[01:17:50.860] >> Thank you. One question I have is,

[01:17:53.110] is there two way communication with the system,

[01:17:55.780] which means is there a mechanism by which you can control or shut on or off the water?

[01:18:01.075] >> There are meters that I think they're called ally.

[01:18:05.965] The ally meters do have a feature that would

[01:18:10.930] allow us to remotely turn on and turn off the meters.

[01:18:15.370] Right now we're not recommending a full installation of those meters.

[01:18:23.590] They are a higher dollar meter.

[01:18:26.020] But we may strategically place them in areas in the system.

[01:18:33.520] I haven't personally looked at that closely.

[01:18:36.310] Jonathan has been managing this project and I know he has.

[01:18:40.525] I believe we do plan on strategically placing some of those meters in certain locations.

[01:18:46.240] But we won't do a full sale instalIation of them.

[01:18:49.720] >> We don't need to. I understand if it did exist.

[01:18:53.080] I saw that our water Master plan a couple of years ago.

[01:18:56.140] My other question was related to what Counselor Geiger spoke with,

[01:19:00.970] which is, our accuracy will improve,

[01:19:03.250] but to a customer.

[01:19:04.630] They'll just see their bill increase.

[01:19:06.550] I just want to make sure that we're aware of the communication plan.

[01:19:10.510] I'm glad to see that there is one.

[01:19:13.120] Then the 20 year period struck me as long for technology,

[01:19:18.235] especially a technology software item in particular.

[01:19:21.820] Twenty year agreements, you say these other utilities

[01:19:24.400] have 20 year agreements, is that right?

[01:19:27.010] >> It's standard. Our current system has a 20 year.

[01:19:31.945] I wouldn't call it an agreement because we didn't really have

[01:19:34.045] a contract like we are for this one,

[01:19:36.955] which is why I wanted to have a contract in place.

[01:19:40.435] But it is normal for metering systems to have a useful life of 20 years.

[01:19:48.325] Some of them make it 20 years,

[01:19:50.560] some of them don't.

[01:19:54.270] >> Thank you.

[01:19:56.125] >> Some of my questions are answered,

[01:19:57.580] the 20 year contract.

[01:19:59.350] I've never seen a 20 year contract since I've been up here,

[01:20:01.630] but I understand the reasoning behind it.

[01:20:04.825] Are these what they call smart meters?

[01:20:07.330] >> Smart meters.

[01:20:08.080] >> Yeah. I know there was in the past,

[01:20:11.665] when Smart Meters first came out,

[01:20:13.090] people were afraid the utility could just shut your water off

[01:20:17.080] or but you said you're going to place those somewhat strategically in the town?

[01:20:23.260] >> Yeah. If we need to,

[01:20:26.830] we will place them strategically,

[01:20:28.630] we would never shut somebody off without

[01:20:30.505] notifying them or for the proper notice and all that.[LAUGHTER]

[01:20:33.790] >> I still needs to be manually in the box with the wrench and all that.

[01:20:39.090] In regards to to the antenna,

[01:20:42.010] what about land debris,

[01:20:43.285] dirt getting on that dome and messing with the signal?

[01:20:47.395] >> I have one at my house.

[01:20:50.125] I've never had a problem with it.

[01:20:53.790] It's in an area that's underneath an oak tree?

[01:20:58.555] We've not had any problem.

[01:21:00.760] Unless it gets covered in dirt, like buried.

[01:21:06.025] I don't see that there would be a problem.

[01:21:08.245] >> It sits outside the box.

[01:21:11.065] >> It's in the lid of the box.

[01:21:14.520] >> Some of the mowers are riders and they're heavy

[01:21:17.230] so that they're durable and all that doesn't,

[01:21:19.510] how often do they get damaged, usually?

[01:21:22.405] Is there a percentage on that or

[01:21:26.200] Sure.

[01:21:29.240] The actual mushroom cap itself,

[01:21:31.250] I'm not worried about somebody driving over it.

[01:21:32.990] In fact, they are, call it light traffic rated,

[01:21:35.525] got them placed in driveways and people can drive cars over them and that stuff.

[01:21:39.905] As far as how frequently they're damaged,

[01:21:44.015] it's not a every day thing. It does happen.

[01:21:47.525] I would say the two most common causes I see with

[01:21:50.600] damage is people burning lawn leaves and stuff in the fall,

[01:21:53.990] and for some reason, they decide to burn it over the top of meter box and melt it down.

[01:21:58.460] Occasionally, we do have some that get hit by a lawn mower.

[01:22:02.840] Usually that's an education process.

[01:22:05.285] If you're mowing your grass at the millimeters,

[01:22:09.110] that thing, scalping it,

[01:22:10.160] it's really not good for the lawn anyway.

[01:22:11.990] But the other side of it is just making sure

[01:22:15.560] that if the box sets a little bit high in the yard,

[01:22:20.150] we lower it down and work with the home.

[01:22:23.240] Main concern is a lot of people have just lawn maintenance services,

[01:22:26.555] and these guys come in with the riding mowers and they're

[01:22:28.610] just running around, they don't care what they hit.

[01:22:31.025] They're trying to get the job in quickly,

[01:22:32.750] so things need to be flushed to the ground

[01:22:35.180] and even lower than a scalping more like a homeowner we do.

[01:22:39.155] I said, we've got many systems in the surrounding area.

[01:22:43.430] We did almost 200,000 of these in Palm Beach County and it happens,

[01:22:49.520] but it's not a common everyday occurring.

[01:22:53.405] Just don't think it happens. A lot of times unless they really get deep with the damage,

[01:22:58.160] you can replace the housing and you're just fine,

[01:23:00.470] long as you don't Breach the housing where moisture can get into the electronics.

[01:23:05.600] I imagined I'm not a meter expert.

[01:23:07.850] The old meters probably had some impeller inside than when the water and through

[01:23:11.450] it spun spinning device, let's that.

[01:23:16.070] How do these work?

[01:23:18.940] This is what they call an electromagnetic magneter,

[01:23:22.940] and essentially, it places a charge,

[01:23:25.655] let's call it a very low voltage field of energy,

[01:23:30.755] if you want to call it that and what it's looking for

[01:23:33.245] is as water has some type of mineral in it.

[01:23:37.115] Let's call it iron,

[01:23:38.150] calcium, some particulate,

[01:23:42.875] and it knows how much water is in the pipe,

[01:23:46.355] and it measures the speed of what things

[01:23:49.295] are going past the sensors that are in the meter,

[01:23:52.610] so it's able to deduce very accurately.

[01:23:54.995] It's not a new technology.

[01:23:56.675] Magmeter technology has been around since the 1800s.

[01:23:59.720] It knows the volume and it's just reading the speed and calculating.

[01:24:02.720] Correct.

[01:24:03.140] Volume. Interesting.

[01:24:05.060] It's very old, very reliable.

[01:24:08.980] Typically in the past,

[01:24:10.660] you had to have electricity to make it work.

[01:24:12.835] Evolution of battery technology is what's all evolved

[01:24:15.730] this into being able to do this in a residential application.

[01:24:19.135] Is a lithium battery inside or solar or how does it work?

[01:24:25.325] It's a lithium type of battery.

[01:24:28.340] It's a very long range type of battery technology that census has.

[01:24:33.005] We've had very good results.

[01:24:34.700] We sold our first Flex system Florida in 2007 in Apopka and they're still ticking along.

[01:24:42.650] Been doing this 20 years now and some of

[01:24:44.810] the earlier systems that I sold are still up and running.

[01:24:47.555] It must be a super low voltage.

[01:24:49.220] Very low voltage and it also uses capacitors so it's not like a constant on,

[01:24:54.590] I just is a slow drain on the battery a constant poll.

[01:24:59.030] Got you. I think that's it. Thank you. Appreciate it.

[01:25:03.140] Thank you.

[01:25:03.980] Thank you. Director Amander and your staff done a great job.

[01:25:07.400] A lot of my questions have been answered,

[01:25:08.990] but I want to go back to your comment earlier

[01:25:12.110] about approximately 450 to 500

[01:25:16.100] right now failures that staff have to go out and make repairs.

[01:25:20.180] Yes.

[01:25:20.915] Staff a lot of time and revenue.

[01:25:24.560] It cost a lot of money to go out there.

[01:25:26.315] What are we going to be saving when?

[01:25:28.175] Once this is all done,

[01:25:29.750] and we don't have that issue anymore.

[01:25:32.795] That's a cost savings by itself so in 2025,

[01:25:38.900] we estimated just on staff time to address the failed registers.

[01:25:44.090] We probably spent about $110,000 in staff time.

[01:25:48.830] Some of that was overtime.

[01:25:50.600] Some of that was during the regular.

[01:25:52.370] [OVERLAPPING] It basically took staff away from doing other duties.

[01:26:00.350] That what they have.

[01:26:02.225] On that 20 year contract,

[01:26:04.340] it's just to correlate with the life of the product itself and the meters.

[01:26:10.145] The antenna, I was very glad you got clarification on that because I

[01:26:14.150] was trying to figure out how it was not going to get damaged.

[01:26:18.455] The battery life, and you've mentioned,

[01:26:22.160] I think it was a Popca,

[01:26:23.495] a 2007, and they're still going strong.

[01:26:26.660] When the batteries do fail at whatever point it might be and maybe never,

[01:26:32.420] how do you not how does that work that you know the batteries died?

[01:26:38.360] If we won't be able to get we won't get a read back.

[01:26:41.450] I'm sure the system would probably allow.

[01:26:43.370] I didn't know the system had a way of communicating that back.

[01:26:46.280] The good thing about the small meters is if the battery fails,

[01:26:52.070] which means the register fail,

[01:26:54.665] we can get a manual reading on it as well,

[01:26:57.845] which we cannot do right now with many of our existing meters.

[01:27:02.740] I was just going to say it does have a low battery alarm.

[01:27:06.740] It takes every time it sends a transmission packet of data,

[01:27:10.625] and it's not just the meter read,

[01:27:12.230] it actually sends a packet of data.

[01:27:15.320] One of the items that's in the packet is a battery voltage.

[01:27:19.295] It keeps track of the battery voltage on the battery itself in the transmitter,

[01:27:23.000] and when it starts detecting

[01:27:24.680] a certain threshold where some will call it a low battery alarm,

[01:27:27.890] which is usually about six months of life left in the battery,

[01:27:31.040] it'll flag and say,

[01:27:32.630] I've got a low battery.

[01:27:33.950] That gives you an opportunity to go out and do some proactive maintenance type processes.

[01:27:41.765] The other side, you did mention it as well is there is a transmitter in the field,

[01:27:48.020] there is a meter in the field,

[01:27:49.835] that's a separate device.

[01:27:51.725] If the transmitter fails,

[01:27:54.170] you can go out and get the reading off of the meter.

[01:27:57.365] If the meter fails,

[01:27:58.850] because it's pulling the data up from the meter on an hourly basis,

[01:28:06.170] you can go and get the transmitter data

[01:28:08.285] up until the point of failure of the meter itself.

[01:28:10.595] The data doesn't disappear.

[01:28:12.500] It's stored in two different locations.

[01:28:14.675] The resident would never really even know this was happened,

[01:28:18.995] you're going to get the notice first through your data supply?

[01:28:22.370] Yes.

[01:28:23.675] The last question and you talked about it,

[01:28:26.750] the small increase that the resident will have on a monthly basis.

[01:28:30.970] Communication, you've been very succinct on how we're going to get it out there.

[01:28:35.750] I think that's real important because they can relate to smart technology,

[01:28:40.160] new technology, and to the accuracy will be there for them to control.

[01:28:45.815] I think that's a real highlight of this product.

[01:28:48.065] Thank you for your hard work.

[01:28:49.325] You're welcome.

[01:28:52.420] Any more questions. Seeing no,

[01:28:56.615] I'll take a motion in a second.

[01:28:58.715] I'll make a motion to approve.

[01:29:00.605] Second.

[01:29:01.895] Just for discussion. I didn't have any questions to ask,

[01:29:05.840] but I cannot support the contract award so first of all, let me make it clear.

[01:29:12.875] I have no issue with regard to the need for the project.

[01:29:16.025] I have no issue with regard to recommended contractor equipment or services.

[01:29:23.990] I support of that.

[01:29:26.285] I can't support the contract award on the basis of

[01:29:28.700] my longstanding differences of opinions about the War of utilities,

[01:29:32.390] procurement, fiscal management and contract negotiation practices.

[01:29:38.350] Sum rate key takeaways.

[01:29:41.120] Calling main was deemed by

[01:29:43.310] the water utility staff to be the most qualified and therefore,

[01:29:47.210] it's top rate for the project.

[01:29:50.060] I may even agree that they were the most qualified.

[01:29:54.110] But their net based bid prices were 4.7000003 million

[01:30:00.080] higher than a little bitter for the width

[01:30:03.050] versus without optional equipment scenarios respectively.

[01:30:06.545] It's a big cost difference.

[01:30:07.730] I would have liked to have seen that be pursued further.

[01:30:11.860] The claim contract negotiation with CNM,

[01:30:17.225] staff top rank firm result in scope of work and associated cost reductions.

[01:30:23.660] That was the millions of dollars so it's always the case when

[01:30:27.080] you talk about if you can reduce costs.

[01:30:32.560] That could well have been the case with the apparent little bidder.

[01:30:36.470] However, we don't have that information because of the town's procurement practices of

[01:30:41.195] negotiating with its preferred supplier.

[01:30:46.355] The claim financial benefits for water meter accuracy improvements,

[01:30:54.875] estimated at 1.3 million per year from, increased water revenues.

[01:31:02.165] Let me say this clearly.

[01:31:04.865] From a water utility customer perspective,

[01:31:08.105] and also mine is elected official.

[01:31:11.645] This would actually represent a water rate hike and not a financial benefit to them.

[01:31:17.480] Net evaluations and spending decisions should always

[01:31:21.620] be performed on a net customer benefit basis.

[01:31:25.430] Historically, we knew we've always known that

[01:31:29.600] meters over the course of time work in the favor of the customer.

[01:31:33.890] But that's built into our system.

[01:31:35.955] I don't think anybody will be surprised on the diets that the

[01:31:39.730] next time somebody comes and asks for an annual increase.

[01:31:43.915] I'm going to ponder about gee,

[01:31:46.770] already got their increase because we're so more to consumption.

[01:31:50.510] We're now saying it's higher and it is, I get it.

[01:31:53.585] But the point is,

[01:31:55.325] I just evaluate things differently.

[01:31:57.620] You should always look from the customer benefit basis.

[01:32:01.660] The expedited implementation schedule for a full conversion from

[01:32:06.740] five years to two years reportedly resulted in $1 million savings.

[01:32:12.320] The implementation schedule change will effectively

[01:32:15.440] consume a net 1.5 years of a new meters useful life.

[01:32:21.350] This should have been taken into account in the project decision,

[01:32:24.560] evaluation as I've long advocated.

[01:32:30.430] We could have managed in my opinion,

[01:32:33.545] the fact that I think the existing meters were

[01:32:37.400] replaced over a much longer schedule basis period.

[01:32:43.190] I think it might have been as much as ten years,

[01:32:45.200] but it's not worth asking the question whether it was seven,

[01:32:48.350] ten, I was over many years.

[01:32:50.540] It would be predictable to me that the oldest ones would be the ones you'd be

[01:32:55.160] replacing so you don't have to do 100% of them to really knock that number down.

[01:33:01.265] I believe you should be able to tell based on how long they're in there

[01:33:04.340] so I would have that's the way in my former day job,

[01:33:08.465] how we would have managed the project differently.

[01:33:11.915] Then the annual software lease agreement,

[01:33:15.500] cost increases were 3% a year,

[01:33:18.185] which exceeds the historical 20 year inflationary rate.

[01:33:22.190] I think this should have been negotiated for annual increases at CPI or less.

[01:33:28.460] With an not to exceed annual cap.

[01:33:31.280] That's the business storm I'm familiar with.

[01:33:33.710] I tell you, I'm sure we all feel the same way.

[01:33:37.040] A lot of these projects when they have a ongoing future cost that is going to exceed CPI,

[01:33:45.350] I wonder how we're going to cover that cost in the future.

[01:33:49.685] These are just issues.

[01:33:52.385] I've said everything here before.

[01:33:55.295] I just have different approach to how this would have been done.

[01:33:59.555] Whether it came out with a different outcome.

[01:34:01.805] I know the evaluation would be claiming benefits that are claimed here,

[01:34:06.020] but we'll never know so with that,

[01:34:08.600] we have a motion in a second.All in favor,

[01:34:11.360] signify by saying aye.

[01:34:12.770] I just want to quickly say something.

[01:34:14.555] I do want to say that to the customer,

[01:34:17.120] there is also a benefit.

[01:34:18.575] I think it is more complex and nuanced,

[01:34:20.810] as Councilor Guisinger said.

[01:34:23.345] With the cost, which I think we're all concerned about,

[01:34:26.975] I think the resident will see it.

[01:34:28.910] As an increase.

[01:34:30.275] Granted a $2 increase,

[01:34:31.820] but I think we're sensitive to that.

[01:34:33.935] But there's also an increased level of service.

[01:34:36.440] I think understanding and being able to track daily use,

[01:34:39.455] all the information at our fingertap tips that we've never had before on a daily basis.

[01:34:44.780] The ability to better conserve water and resources town wide,

[01:34:48.950] I think is really valuable.

[01:34:50.630] I just want to share that,

[01:34:52.685] I think that it's very nuanced and complex,

[01:34:56.810] and I think there are some of this is not ideal.

[01:35:00.770] The rates of failure that we're dealing with,

[01:35:03.125] we need to do this and get it done.

[01:35:05.825] But there's some real good in

[01:35:08.690] this technology and I know that we have been talking about it,

[01:35:11.990] at least since I joined Council in 2022.

[01:35:14.510] I want to say thank you for the work that you've done.

[01:35:16.820] I know that this is a big project.

[01:35:20.920] The utility is also an enterprise fund,

[01:35:23.990] and it's quasi run like a business where so you're

[01:35:29.300] distributing your product and you're not being compensated

[01:35:32.360] efficiently so I think you need to get everything up to speed.

[01:35:36.155] That's built in the race.

[01:35:38.180] They want to debate and by the way,

[01:35:40.250] I know there's other benefits.

[01:35:41.930] I'm going based on the way it was presented here was I'm just used to

[01:35:46.655] a much different totality of evaluation

[01:35:49.865] where those benefits could have been taken account.

[01:35:53.900] We had a we water leak in my house that wasn't caught by the

[01:35:57.965] original I was stunned that the utility never called me to tell me,

[01:36:02.420] but they didn't have that capability.

[01:36:04.535] There can be you better believe I got a significant water bill.

[01:36:08.780] It of people had.

[01:36:10.840] Particularly in heavy tree area neighborhoods.

[01:36:15.230] I understand all that,

[01:36:16.385] but I think the points I made were valid and I just would like to going four someday.

[01:36:20.945] For these thing, the evaluations be done differently and taking this into account,

[01:36:26.165] then I'd be more comfortable about it.

[01:36:28.070] With that, we have a motion to second all in favor,

[01:36:30.320] signify by saying aye.

[01:36:31.670] Aye.

[01:36:32.935] >> Posed made, the motion carries 4:1 with Mayor Kuretski to start off.

[01:36:39.770] Moving on to Resolution 120-25,

[01:36:44.865] approving contracts to four contractors for general contracting continuing services,

[01:36:52.350] turn it over to staff.

[01:37:05.300] >> Good evening, Mayor, Council.

[01:37:07.755] For the record, George Dzama,

[01:37:09.315] the Director of Engineering and Public Works.

[01:37:12.625] Please to request Town Council's approval of Resolution 120-25 in

[01:37:17.720] the Award of four Continuing Services Contracts to Catchment Construction,

[01:37:22.665] RCAS LLC, Proctor Construction,

[01:37:25.425] and Fierce Construction for General Contracting,

[01:37:28.710] and a combined amount not to exceed $6 million

[01:37:32.220] for a three-year term with two optional one-year renewal terms.

[01:37:37.605] This is a versatile contract that is intended to be utilized by multiple departments,

[01:37:44.385] in addition to engineering and public works.

[01:37:48.045] There's parks, utilities, planning and zoning.

[01:37:51.690] All departments that are responsible for facilities.

[01:37:55.650] The contract scope is outlined in the executive summary.

[01:38:00.000] Some of the highlights are the building and facility site work.

[01:38:05.355] We have building construction,

[01:38:07.020] including structural, mechanical, electrical,

[01:38:10.155] plumbing, building roofing, building envelope,

[01:38:14.295] and weather protection, and site monument construction.

[01:38:18.645] The contracts will be used for budgeted projects,

[01:38:23.130] unless otherwise approved by the council.

[01:38:25.425] Projects will be assigned via work order based on availability of funds,

[01:38:29.730] project costs, and availability to meet project schedules.

[01:38:33.720] In addition, projects will be based on price,

[01:38:37.620] responsiveness, and quality of workmanship.

[01:38:41.280] Most project assignments will have a value of less than 300,000.

[01:38:46.005] There were some projects,

[01:38:50.145] higher-scale projects that were included in the bid that are attached,

[01:38:56.010] which are included in the fiscal year 2026,

[01:39:00.690] CIP, and operating and maintenance budgets.

[01:39:04.845] Most of those projects are park facility projects as well

[01:39:09.510] as a few public works and utility storage building projects.

[01:39:15.740] The intent of this contract is much like

[01:39:21.750] the resurfacing contract that was awarded at the last council meeting.

[01:39:27.825] However, this is strictly for buildings and facilities,

[01:39:31.980] and the procurement process was a request for proposal in which

[01:39:36.210] the contractors were selected based on prices,

[01:39:41.565] qualifications, and an understanding of the contract intended use.

[01:39:46.665] The score sheet from the selection committee is also attached in the agenda item.

[01:39:54.320] I'm pleased that there were 11 bids received,

[01:39:59.700] so there's a great interest in doing work for the town and working with our staff.

[01:40:05.925] Two of the bidders were deemed non-responsive as there was

[01:40:10.080] a requirement for a Florida general contractor license.

[01:40:18.350] I also would like to mention the benefits of the contract.

[01:40:23.220] Much like the street resurfacing contract,

[01:40:27.060] this contract will provide cost control and accelerated contract time.

[01:40:31.455] It also will assist with staff workload for facility maintenance projects.

[01:40:38.490] Some of the larger-scale mechanical,

[01:40:41.955] electrical and plumbing projects can be utilized by this project to alleviate

[01:40:46.950] stack workload for some of

[01:40:48.690] the smaller-scale projects that could be utilized with in-house staff.

[01:40:53.205] Also, this project was bid with FEMA provisions.

[01:40:57.270] Work can be reimbursed and declared emergency revents.

[01:41:03.050] One final note was that this contract was bid prior to

[01:41:08.310] the bid qualification requirement for experience modification rate, or EMR.

[01:41:14.145] However, staff confirmed that the contractors had an EMR of one.

[01:41:20.480] With that, I'll answer any questions.

[01:41:24.090] >> Any questions?

[01:41:25.920] >> Just quickly. Tell me,

[01:41:27.630] do you have any idea what the staff savings will be with this six million here?

[01:41:35.540] >> It's hard to say because the projects are the smaller-scale projects,

[01:41:41.730] and they'll be awarded on an individual project basis.

[01:41:46.435] But the cost savings that we'll see can range anywhere from 10-15%

[01:41:54.980] because the bid form provided the in-house

[01:41:59.820] labor rates as well as subcontractor markup and material markup.

[01:42:05.325] Some of the mark-ups that we received in the bids were 5%,

[01:42:11.910] which is about 10% cheaper than usual bids that are about 15.

[01:42:19.260] >> Then, with the FEMA reimbursement,

[01:42:22.260] is that a wash?

[01:42:24.165] Are we not getting FEMA reimbursements now for what we might get with this contract?

[01:42:31.155] >> This is just a provision that we have in the bid a lot oftentimes to get reimbursed.

[01:42:38.655] I can't speak for what was cost reimbursement in the past because I was not here,

[01:42:44.880] but typically to utilize

[01:42:48.480] vendors to be reimbursed for infrastructure repairs.

[01:42:56.400] FEMA provisions need to be implemented in the bid.

[01:42:59.730] They require bids.

[01:43:00.870] This will just accelerate the time that we can get

[01:43:03.510] projects done and we can get reimbursed quicker.

[01:43:07.215] >> Thank you.

[01:43:08.250] >> You are welcome.

[01:43:09.285] >> Vice Mayor.

[01:43:10.410] >> No questions, but I like the structure of this.

[01:43:12.390] You did a nice drama with this. Appreciate it. Thank you.

[01:43:14.790] >> Councilor Sundstrom.

[01:43:16.710] >> My question answered.

[01:43:17.940] Interesting material markup information there. Thank you.

[01:43:22.400] >> No questions for me. Thank you.

[01:43:25.730] >> Can you just explain probably in here and I hadn't seen,

[01:43:32.790] but the work authorization process,

[01:43:35.550] are all work authorizations signed without coming to counsel?

[01:43:44.085] Because I've seen this recently,

[01:43:46.260] where we had there may be a general dollar threshold.

[01:43:50.010] I don't know what it exists,

[01:43:51.240] but is there a dollar threshold that does come to council even

[01:43:54.270] though you'd be using these contracts, question?

[01:43:58.095] >> The intent was to utilize the threshold values within our procurement policy.

[01:44:05.475] For say contracts less than $50,000,

[01:44:11.310] it can be authorized by the town manager.

[01:44:13.845] But projects with work order values greater certainly will go before council.

[01:44:25.610] Most of the projects will be under 300,000 so they could be presented.

[01:44:30.795] >> You answered the question and just to be clear,

[01:44:34.770] so there's nothing in this that says whether it goes to

[01:44:37.650] the council or nothing in the agreement,

[01:44:40.740] because that's something perhaps we as a council can look at.

[01:44:44.850] I'm okay with having a higher dollar value being authorized by the town manager.

[01:44:50.940] Most contracts we see are not this type of contract.

[01:44:54.990] It clearly says the mayor,

[01:44:59.160] with the council,

[01:45:00.420] makes the decision and other times town manager.

[01:45:03.735] Just leave it as an open item doesn't

[01:45:06.270] affect the agreement that I think 50,000 is too low.

[01:45:09.870] It's just the absence of seeing it jump out that is why I asked that question.

[01:45:14.910] Did you want to say something about that, Mr. Reynolds?

[01:45:18.380] >> Thank you, Mayor. What I want to just quickly say

[01:45:21.390] is you've mentioned this a couple of different times,

[01:45:24.330] we do have a new procurement manager on staff.

[01:45:27.735] We are currently reviewing the procurement policy.

[01:45:31.710] I envision that there's going to be some changes,

[01:45:34.185] and maybe some of those changes are exactly what you're talking about.

[01:45:37.440] There could be some changes in the thresholds based on these types of activities.

[01:45:42.735] >> One of the things I just want to point out

[01:45:45.090] and recognize staff on this particular work,

[01:45:49.320] and I realize all work is different.

[01:45:51.165] This is an engineering services contractor services,

[01:45:54.180] but I'm grateful that the bid evaluation assigned 70% the cost.

[01:46:02.805] That's what I always advocate.

[01:46:04.695] A lot of them,

[01:46:05.955] the cost historically had been a lot lower.

[01:46:09.330] I'm comforted by that.

[01:46:10.905] I was also comforted by the fact that all four staff members evaluated 1,

[01:46:20.640] 02, 3, 4 the same.

[01:46:22.755] I take comfort in that because I do believe that these were senior evaluations,

[01:46:30.960] and all of them, just the fact that they were the same, gives me confidence.

[01:46:35.910] That may not always be the case,

[01:46:37.380] but that's why in this case,

[01:46:39.495] I think the threshold could be higher,

[01:46:41.700] but again, that's something you could come back on.

[01:46:45.075] Because for a threshold to be higher,

[01:46:47.955] I just want to always make sure that cost is given appropriate consideration,

[01:46:52.155] which, in some cases, it hasn't been.

[01:46:54.300] Again, good work.

[01:46:55.665] I do think that, as you know,

[01:47:02.500] how do you pronounce your name?

[01:47:05.120] I guess I've been scared to say it?

[01:47:07.085] >> The D is silent, Dzama.

[01:47:09.620] >> Dzama. Thank you.

[01:47:13.490] Anyway, in a long time,

[01:47:18.315] I think I've heard you say that we have unit prices,

[01:47:21.540] so you're going to know the cost for those projects that are that well defined.

[01:47:27.465] >> Well, that was for their street resurfacing,

[01:47:30.240] for this contract, it's a little different.

[01:47:32.910] We have labor rates and we have markup.

[01:47:35.895] We generally know the scope,

[01:47:38.025] so we can really pin down.

[01:47:39.975] We have cost control. We'll put it that way.

[01:47:42.705] >> Now, realize, we talked earlier today,

[01:47:45.750] the copy that I saw didn't have the amount

[01:47:48.900] of unit rates because it wasn't in the hard copy that I got.

[01:47:52.680] But anyway, I'm comfortable with this and appreciate answering the questions.

[01:48:00.495] Thank you. If there's no more questions,

[01:48:03.420] I'll take a motion in a second to approve Resolution 120-25.

[01:48:08.730] >> Motion to approve.

[01:48:09.720] >> Second.

[01:48:10.635] >> Motion and a second. All in favor,

[01:48:12.300] signify by saying aye.

[01:48:13.740] >> [OVERLAPPING] Aye.

[01:48:14.490] >> Motion carries unanimously.

[01:48:17.025] Moving on to reports, Town attorney?

[01:48:19.635] >> I have no report. Thank you, Mayor.

[01:48:21.810] >> Town Manager?

[01:48:23.040] >> Thank you, Mayor. Just a few things.

[01:48:25.695] In October, residents began receiving invitations to

[01:48:29.580] participate in the town citizen survey, as you all know.

[01:48:33.690] Just for information purposes,

[01:48:36.000] the survey is being operated by POCO,

[01:48:38.145] the nation's leader in resident engagement in polling,

[01:48:42.030] which conducts a science-based study for the town.

[01:48:45.150] For those who POCO selected to take part in the survey,

[01:48:48.480] you have until December 15 to complete the survey.

[01:48:51.840] Selected participants will receive a postcard reminder in the mail in the coming days,

[01:48:56.835] reminding them about how to participate.

[01:48:59.580] Also, as a follow-up to an item that was raised during

[01:49:02.520] the last town council meeting the town completed

[01:49:05.190] construction on stormwater drainage improvements along Bush Road last Wednesday,

[01:49:11.220] November 26, and the road has been reopened.

[01:49:14.820] Next week, a contractor will perform asphalt milling and overlay to complete the project.

[01:49:20.430] During this final phase of the project,

[01:49:22.320] the road will remain open,

[01:49:23.775] and flagman will manage traffic.

[01:49:26.700] The town plans on using its social media website and email platforms to

[01:49:30.750] communicate with the public about this roadwork before it begins.

[01:49:35.565] Also, yesterday, the town launched

[01:49:38.070] the new Citizen Recognition program called Jupiter's Home Town Heroes,

[01:49:44.445] and this program allows residents to nominate a fellow resident,

[01:49:48.525] business owner or volunteers who make a difference in the Jupiter community.

[01:49:52.710] Once a nomination is received,

[01:49:54.540] it'll be evaluated by a committee of town staff,

[01:49:57.450] and those individuals selected will be honored at a town council meeting.

[01:50:03.620] We began promoting this program yesterday through

[01:50:06.840] the Town's social media email distribution list and website,

[01:50:10.410] and have already begun to receive nominations, which is great.

[01:50:14.670] We will continue to promote the program through

[01:50:17.070] all of our distribution channels and look forward to

[01:50:19.230] celebrating the community members who make us uniquely Jupiter in the near future.

[01:50:24.570] I wanted to provide you with an update on our negotiations with

[01:50:28.980] the PBA regarding a contract for our police sergeants and officers.

[01:50:34.080] After multiple months of negotiations,

[01:50:38.310] I'm happy to announce that the town and PBA have

[01:50:41.220] reached a tentative agreement on a contract.

[01:50:44.655] The PBA has scheduled a vote by our officers and

[01:50:49.020] sergeants to ratify this contract on December 12 and December 15.

[01:50:54.165] I also want to remind you that this ratification by

[01:50:58.380] the officers is the required first step in the contract approval process.

[01:51:04.590] Should the union ratify the contract,

[01:51:06.840] we will bring the contract to the town council for a vote at the next available meeting,

[01:51:12.405] and if all goes well,

[01:51:13.710] that will be January 6, 2026.

[01:51:17.940] We will not let any grass grow under our feet.

[01:51:20.985] If that contract gets ratified,

[01:51:23.160] you will see it at the first meeting in January.

[01:51:25.635] Unfortunately, given the dates that they've selected,

[01:51:28.305] I won't be able to get it on the agenda for the last meeting of the year.

[01:51:33.730] >> Also, I want to close by reminding everyone of some of

[01:51:36.800] the holiday events that occur in the town in the weeks ahead.

[01:51:40.775] This Friday, December 5,

[01:51:42.395] the town will hold its annual holiday tree lighting.

[01:51:44.690] This year, the event has been moved to

[01:51:46.130] the Town Green located here on the municipal campus.

[01:51:49.865] I'm sure many of you saw the decorations and how amazing this campus looks right now.

[01:51:56.300] I can't wait to see what it's going to look like on Friday night when the tree is lit up.

[01:52:01.580] The event will begin at 5:00 PM and will feature food trucks,

[01:52:05.180] performances by local schools and community groups,

[01:52:07.730] and at 6:25 PM,

[01:52:09.695] the official lighting of the Town's tree for the first time at the Town green will occur.

[01:52:16.055] On Saturday evening, the annual Holiday Boat parade will be held and

[01:52:19.370] should arrive in Jupiter between 7:30 and 8:00 PM.

[01:52:22.760] On Saturday, December 13,

[01:52:24.950] the town will hold its annual snow place like Jupiter event.

[01:52:28.325] This event, always a favorite of children who get to play in the real snow,

[01:52:32.735] will be held at Abacoa Community Park from 3:00 PM until 6:00 PM.

[01:52:37.745] The annual JTAA holiday parade will occur on Sunday, December 14.

[01:52:44.225] As a reminder, the town does not set the route for the parade.

[01:52:47.720] We work with the JTAA committee,

[01:52:49.955] and they select where they would like to have the parade,

[01:52:53.630] and then we work to support their wishes,

[01:52:56.315] which is what has occurred again this year. That's my report, Mayor.

[01:53:01.270] >> Thank you. Councilor Choy?

[01:53:06.620] >> Thank you, Mayor.

[01:53:09.440] First, I want to thank all of the students that submitted

[01:53:13.610] for the centennial art and poetry contest.

[01:53:17.780] The winners were extraordinary.

[01:53:19.925] The talent at such a young age.

[01:53:22.940] Question for our town manager.

[01:53:25.790] Will any of the winning entries can we get any recopy?

[01:53:36.400] They were great.

[01:53:39.700] I don't know what you call them when you get something that's reproduced from it?

[01:53:44.990] Yeah, print. Thank you.

[01:53:47.000] Just a thought.

[01:53:48.710] They were great.

[01:53:50.585] I also want to thank Chief Tennessee for that great update on the vessel. Thank you.

[01:53:56.750] Again, to thank our Jupiter Police Department for everything that they do.

[01:54:00.645] The town campus is like Disneyland.

[01:54:04.790] I came in here tonight,

[01:54:06.200] and I felt like a little kid in a candy store.

[01:54:08.510] It looks beautiful.

[01:54:10.730] It absolutely looks great.

[01:54:12.875] I do want to thank all of the staff for their presentations tonight.

[01:54:17.120] There was a lot of work put into everything,

[01:54:19.520] and I do appreciate it. Thank you.

[01:54:22.805] >> Vice Mayor.

[01:54:24.440] >> Thank you, Mayor. The town green does look great.

[01:54:28.910] You always said we're building everything out.

[01:54:31.070] He said, "Do you see this thing?

[01:54:32.210] It's going to look great." It really does.

[01:54:34.010] But the lights just lit everything up. Just just one thing.

[01:54:38.345] As you may or may not know,

[01:54:40.655] Christmas is on a Thursday,

[01:54:42.740] and town employees have Christmas Eve off, correct?

[01:54:47.195] I would like to make a motion.

[01:54:48.680] I think you all would agree to,

[01:54:50.090] let's have the town employees to get the Friday off paid so they have a nice long break.

[01:54:55.520] It's been a long year.

[01:54:57.740] They've worked really hard,

[01:54:58.970] so I would like to make a motion to give town employees December 26 off paid.

[01:55:04.910] >> Just so it's clear,

[01:55:09.100] they'll have Wednesday, Thursday,

[01:55:11.900] is the current policy, correct?

[01:55:15.380] >> That's correct, Mayor.

[01:55:17.105] >> Okay. Then we're adding Friday.

[01:55:18.950] We've done that before.

[01:55:20.765] I'm okay with that. I just want to have the clarity of which was the days.

[01:55:24.455] >> Yeah. It would be the 26th day after.

[01:55:27.455] >> You want to make a motion for that?

[01:55:29.495] >> I just did.

[01:55:30.245] >> I would make it second [OVERLAPPING].

[01:55:34.430] >> Motion to give town employees December 26 off paid.

[01:55:41.360] >> I'll second the motion.

[01:55:42.650] >> Motion and a second in favor signify by saying aye.

[01:55:45.635] >> Aye.

[01:55:47.710] >> Thank you, Vice Mayor. I know they'll appreciate that.

[01:55:52.130] >> Nice break in the action. Thank you.

[01:55:55.780] >> Anything else?

[01:55:56.830] >> No, that's it.

[01:55:57.760] >> There's three items. First of all, Town Manager,

[01:56:01.300] the report about reaching

[01:56:04.045] tentative agreement is the most thrilling thing I've heard in a while.

[01:56:09.745] Oh, my gosh. Thank you.

[01:56:12.670] I know there has been a lot of effort put into that by all parties and boy,

[01:56:18.875] thank you for sharing that.

[01:56:21.610] Obvious, hopefully you'll let us know as soon as you've heard the results from the vote,

[01:56:29.000] and we are hopeful the tentative agreement means that it'll pass.

[01:56:34.720] But it's been a long time.

[01:56:37.030] We've been trying to get this done.

[01:56:38.365] Thank you for the hard work and for getting it done.

[01:56:41.020] The team and the union representatives.

[01:56:45.090] No negative, all positive.

[01:56:47.000] Thank you. Two small items.

[01:56:50.120] I've been starting to use this as housekeeping things,

[01:56:53.060] just to first of all,

[01:56:54.800] and I think this is going to be addressed,

[01:56:56.390] but it's interesting on the Bush Road closure,

[01:56:59.810] when I saw when the town did the social media post that had been opened up,

[01:57:05.165] and I had indicated that,

[01:57:07.820] wow, I was really impacted by that.

[01:57:10.040] I'm so glad when it opened up.

[01:57:12.395] I already saw some people comment.

[01:57:14.420] Well, it's going to be closed again for the intersection project.

[01:57:18.695] I'm not asking for the answer here,

[01:57:20.750] but in the weekly report,

[01:57:22.340] because I would hope that maintenance of

[01:57:23.900] traffic provisions would mean that it would not be closed,

[01:57:28.310] but if it is going to be closed,

[01:57:30.485] I bring this up now because the next time we see this as

[01:57:33.590] a Council is when a contract award comes to us, right?

[01:57:38.270] Normally there's maintenance of traffic,

[01:57:42.920] but I don't know what that will mean.

[01:57:45.170] If the engineering director can just share,

[01:57:48.290] what's the expectation there with regard to whether Bush Road is going to

[01:57:53.540] be closed for some period of

[01:57:55.280] time for that when an intersection improvement project is done?

[01:57:59.345] Again, I think the answer may be no,

[01:58:01.310] but just to the degree that we may be getting questions

[01:58:04.790] about that since it was just recently closed for close to two months.

[01:58:09.170] I just would like all of us to get that answer.

[01:58:13.070] Then lastly, it's a small item,

[01:58:15.050] and I didn't bring it up,

[01:58:16.070] but it's an important one nonetheless,

[01:58:18.230] going forth because I believe what I heard about the water meter clearance requirements.

[01:58:24.470] I'm sure it's not literal,

[01:58:27.860] but I'll just say this.

[01:58:29.135] I heard that there was a requirement of three feet of clearance around the meter box.

[01:58:36.110] If I heard that correct and it wasn't worth bringing it up, first of all,

[01:58:41.540] meters are generally coupled together,

[01:58:45.785] two neighbors side by side, and one box.

[01:58:48.800] It's always right on the property line,

[01:58:52.835] and it's usually right on the front property line.

[01:58:57.710] Well, that's a corner of the property so there's usually a sprinkler right there.

[01:59:02.735] Hopefully, the clearance requirement doesn't take into account sprinklers,

[01:59:06.680] or a lot of people are going to need to move sprinklers.

[01:59:09.065] I don't think that's the case.

[01:59:10.565] I can't imagine that's the case.

[01:59:12.425] But then also, like my house happens to have a street light.

[01:59:15.800] I can't imagine that's going to affect.

[01:59:18.215] I think the answer is,

[01:59:20.330] I'm just bringing that up to make sure that

[01:59:23.540] they engineer it in a way that it isn't impactful because it

[01:59:26.660] wasn't really clear what they meant by it has to be clear around the box.

[01:59:33.500] I'm just trying to avoid and again,

[01:59:36.950] they probably addressed it,

[01:59:38.075] but now that was said tonight,

[01:59:39.230] and I don't want to wait until letters start going out,

[01:59:44.270] and people start thinking they have to relocate things that hopefully

[01:59:48.350] they don't have to that's it. Councilor Sundstrom,.

[01:59:53.540] >> I'll go in order,

[01:59:55.700] I just made a quick list here.

[01:59:57.320] First, I just want to make a point to the threshold,

[02:00:00.125] the 50k threshold,

[02:00:01.745] and our procurement standards.

[02:00:03.200] I do hope that we look at that.

[02:00:05.570] We haven't changed that threshold in years.

[02:00:07.775] If we think about inflation,

[02:00:09.260] everything else, the cost of doing business,

[02:00:11.330] I am glad that we have so many items coming up here,

[02:00:16.700] but I don't necessarily want that many.

[02:00:20.140] I know other municipalities will do really high thresholds,

[02:00:24.380] and they don't see a lot of what happens.

[02:00:26.585] A lot of business doesn't come up to the Council.

[02:00:28.385] I think we've had a good run,

[02:00:31.010] but we do need to look at how costs have changed and our rate of doing business.

[02:00:36.830] I would be supportive of that going forward,

[02:00:38.540] and I'm glad it's being reviewed.

[02:00:40.565] I didn't bring up an item tonight either,

[02:00:43.220] but I did want to just bring attention to Item 7 which is the approval of

[02:00:46.310] the 82-month purchasing agreement for the Police Department in car video system.

[02:00:50.285] I think that's fantastic.

[02:00:52.385] In the past, I've pulled items just to call out how we're using technology to improve

[02:00:57.410] our operational efficiency and

[02:00:59.525] effectiveness in our police department and public safety as a whole.

[02:01:03.830] There are officers who to transfer the video in older systems,

[02:01:08.930] it would take something like half an hour.

[02:01:11.210] I mean, people are held up and across all the videos that they have to do.

[02:01:15.845] It's taking a ton of time so I'm so grateful that that is done away with.

[02:01:21.245] We have in place a couple of license plate readers around town.

[02:01:25.205] Now every single vehicle will have that technology.

[02:01:28.535] It's not just for stolen vehicles or other things like that,

[02:01:31.250] it could be missing persons, or if someone needs help.

[02:01:33.800] I love that we have that capability or that we're going to have that capability.

[02:01:38.210] I love that it's going to serve our department, our officers,

[02:01:41.060] and our public, and I love this use of technology.

[02:01:44.810] I just think that the public should be aware of that,

[02:01:47.090] that we're about to have all of this functionality and efficiency,

[02:01:50.600] and it should be celebrated.

[02:01:52.400] Thank you again, Jupiter Police Department.

[02:01:55.310] That brings me to PBA.

[02:01:57.455] I am so thrilled to hear that. You have no idea.

[02:02:04.360] There's not much to say except for we're happy about this.

[02:02:08.630] Then, the Hometown Heroes program,

[02:02:10.970] thank you, Town Manager, for that.

[02:02:12.935] I think we just recently celebrated an astronaut.

[02:02:16.250] I've heard we had a [inaudible] award one time for a Grinch or other things.

[02:02:21.200] But just recognizing all of the good in this town and all of

[02:02:24.830] the incredible people in this town and the way they step

[02:02:28.280] up in ways seen and unseen I think,

[02:02:32.030] is just so worth highlighting and will be some good news.

[02:02:36.860] We don't always have that in this world today.

[02:02:39.320] I think it's a great small-town feel element. Thank you.

[02:02:47.110] >> I think about being lash and just go ditto.

[02:02:50.645] Whatever to say, but I

[02:02:54.215] appreciate all the presentations made that night

[02:02:56.810] and all the detail and hard work that went into all of it.

[02:02:59.240] Good news with the PBA contract negotiation.

[02:03:02.225] I think everybody feels the same.

[02:03:03.665] Hopefully, that'll get ratified and behind us,

[02:03:05.900] and we'll see it in January.

[02:03:08.000] The Town Citizen Survey,

[02:03:10.460] how will those results be communicated to the Council?

[02:03:13.520] You guys may know, but now I'll at least ask the town manager.

[02:03:17.710] >> Councilor, I can't see you with all this.

[02:03:20.390] >> I know all the flowers.

[02:03:21.635] >> [inaudible] but I'm sure you're down there, somewhere I can hear you.

[02:03:24.710] What will happen is once we get the result,

[02:03:28.205] we'll do a presentation for Council.

[02:03:31.460] Typically, what happens is the vendors will come in and share with us the methodology,

[02:03:39.455] how many surveys went out.

[02:03:41.525] How they tallied up the results,

[02:03:43.655] and then they'll go through the different classifications.

[02:03:46.745] They'll tell us how we did,

[02:03:48.395] and they'll do a comparative analysis with other municipalities,

[02:03:55.310] our size and dimension,

[02:03:59.150] I mean, the dynamics that we have.

[02:04:01.505] It's usually a pretty comprehensive presentation.

[02:04:05.255] >> Then will staff then put together action plans that we'll

[02:04:08.270] see how we're going to address the significant comments?

[02:04:11.870] >> Yes, we will. The first step of that is to present it to the Council.

[02:04:16.775] We'll get a feel for what's coming.

[02:04:19.070] But the first thing we want to do is get the direction from you

[02:04:22.580] all on what's important to you and what you want to see done first.

[02:04:26.735] I'm hopeful and optimistic that those survey results will be as they typically are,

[02:04:35.375] which puts us pretty close to the top of most categories.

[02:04:40.550] But the pressures on us right now and so we're anxious to see the results of that.

[02:04:44.720] >> My last comment was,

[02:04:46.220] I'm on the ears on for the Art Committee.

[02:04:50.810] I had the benefit of sitting at the last meeting.

[02:04:54.410] They actually went through all the various arts, poetry,

[02:04:57.980] and poems, essays,

[02:04:59.090] and everything put together and selected the winners.

[02:05:01.715] I just witnessed the whole thing,

[02:05:03.380] but I did listen in on the essays and the poems that were written by these students,

[02:05:09.485] and they all were very good and emphasized why we love living in Jupiter.

[02:05:13.730] I think they mentioned that they're going to be on the website.

[02:05:17.600] I encourage members of the Council to go out and read them.

[02:05:21.275] They're quite good. I know you asked for the artwork,

[02:05:24.035] which is a lot of good work there,

[02:05:25.850] but the essays and poems were quite good, also. Thank you.

[02:05:29.255] >> I'm glad you brought that up because I was going to ask

[02:05:31.550] the same question if we could get copies of those essays.

[02:05:35.530] >> Just one follow-up,

[02:05:38.315] that Councilor Guisinger brought up with regard to the Citizen survey, number one,

[02:05:44.465] I think historically, we get a copy of the survey results before the presentation.

[02:05:50.765] Because that's helpful, then when we get we then

[02:05:54.110] can ask the consultants a one-time to ask them.

[02:05:57.260] Then number two, because I know all of us spent a lot of time,

[02:06:01.400] that's extremely important valuable information.

[02:06:05.435] But if you didn't already know,

[02:06:08.840] the specific questions that we add are always tailored towards

[02:06:15.260] something that's significant to us from a potential policy setting item.

[02:06:22.355] Probably most of us will go right to those questions as

[02:06:25.760] the starting point because that's not how we've done.

[02:06:29.720] It's what the citizens in Public are saying going forth on issues

[02:06:34.550] of importance so very anxious to see that.

[02:06:39.170] Because again, we picked that as a Council,

[02:06:41.795] just a reminder of those questions.

[02:06:46.240] With that, the time is now 9:06,

[02:06:50.450] and I will adjourn the meeting.
