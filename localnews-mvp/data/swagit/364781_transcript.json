  "fullText": ">> GOOD EVENING. THE TIME IS NOW 7:00 PM. I'LL CALL THE ORDER OF THE TOWN COUNCIL MEETING OF TUESDAY, DECEMBER 16. WE'LL BEGIN WITH AN INVOCATION FOLLOWED BY A MOMENT OF SILENCE, A FEW MOMENTS, AND THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE. IF ALL OF THOSE THAT ARE ABLE, PLEASE JOIN ME IN STANDING. >> LET US PRAY. ALMIGHTY GOD, AS WE GATHER FOR OUR FINAL COUNCIL MEETING OF THE YEAR, WE PAUSE IN GRATITUDE. THANKFUL FOR THE GOOD FORTUNE WE HAVE SHARED, THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE TOGETHER, AND THE SPIRIT OF WARMTH AND GOODWILL THAT SURROUNDS THIS SEASON. WE ASK FOR YOUR GUIDANCE AND WISDOM FOR THE DECISIONS TO BE MADE THIS EVENING AND THROUGHOUT THE COMING YEAR. MAY OUR HOMES, BUSINESSES, AND STREETS BE KEPT SAFE AND MAY THE YEAR AHEAD BRING INCREASED PEACE, SHARED PROSPERITY, AND ENDURING GOODWILL TO ALL, AMEN. WE WILL NOW PAUSE FOR A MOMENT OF SILENCE. >> PLEASE JOIN ME IN THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE? >> >> MAY WE HAVE A ROLL CALL, PLEASE? >> MAYOR KRITSKI. >> HERE. >> VICE MAYOR DELANEY? >> HERE. >> COUNSELOR TROY. >> HERE. >> COUNSELOR GEISINGER? >> HERE. >> COUNSELOR SUNSTROM? >> HERE. >> TOWN MANAGER KITTZIO? >> HERE. >> TOWN ATTORNEY BAIRD? >> HERE. >> WE BEGIN TONIGHT. WE HAVE ONE PRESENTATION GETTING AN UPDATE FROM OUR JUPITER FIRE RESCUE DEPARTMENT. I PRESUME THAT'S GIVEN BY OUR CHIEF. >> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR. COUNSEL, AND ALL THOSE ATTENDING IN PERSON, AS WELL AS THOSE VIRTUALLY WATCHING TONIGHT'S MEETING. WE'RE HONORED TO SHARE AN UPDATE WITH JUPITER FIRE RESCUE. WE'VE BEEN COUNTING DOWN THE MONTHS UNTIL JUPITER FIRE RESCUE BEGINS PROVIDING FIRE AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY. IN LESS THAN SIX MONTHS FROM TONIGHT, WE HAVE HIRED ALL OF OUR OPERATIONAL PERSONNEL, COMPLETED CONSTRUCTION OF OUR NEW FIRE STATIONS, RECEIVED ALL OF OUR FIRE APPARATUS AND AMBULANCES AND COMMENCED TRAINING FOR THE TRANSITION OF SERVICES TO OCCUR ON OCTOBER 1 OF 2026. THE SLIDE BEFORE YOU IS OUR IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE. WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF ORDERING ALL THE NECESSARY SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT FOR AMBULANCES AND FIRE TRUCKS, AND ALL OF THAT WILL BE ARRIVING IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. TONIGHT, I'M GOING TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THREE ITEMS. THE PURCHASE OF OUR SELF-CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS, RECRUITING AND HIRING FOR CAPTAINS, LIEUTENANTS, AND DRIVER ENGINEERS, AS WELL AS THE TEMPORARY FIRE STATION FOR ABACOA AND THE SURROUNDING AREAS. ON YOUR AGENDA TONIGHT IS A REQUEST TO APPROVE THE PURCHASE OF OUR SELF CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS, ALONG WITH THE NECESSARY SUPPORTING EQUIPMENT. OUR SELF CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS IS A SINGLE MOST CRITICAL PIECE OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT A FIREFIGHTER WEARS. IT IS THE LIFELINE THAT ALLOWS OUR PERSONNEL TO BREATHE SAFELY IN TOXIC, SMOKE FILLED, AND OXYGEN DEFICIENT ENVIRONMENTS. WITHOUT THESE, WE SIMPLY CANNOT ENTER A BURNING BUILDING, A CONFINED SPACE ON AN AREA WITH TOXIC SUBSTANCES. THIS IS OUR SELF CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS OR SCBA. THIS IS THE AIR PACK, AND THE FACE MATH, ALONG WITH A PASS DEVICE OR A WARNING DEVICE AND ENGAGE. AS OUTLINED ON THE SLIDE, WE'RE GOING TO BE PURCHASING A FULL ECOSYSTEM OF RESPIRATORY PROTECTION, THAT'S REQUIRED TO LAUNCH OUR DEPARTMENT. THAT INCLUDES 38 MSA G1 XR ADDITION AIR PACKS. THESE ARE THE PRIMARY UNITS WORN ON THE FIREFIGHTERS PACKS, 38 SPARE AIR CYLINDERS. THAT'S IN ADDITION TO THE CYLINDERS THAT COME WITH THE PACKS. THIS ENSURES THAT WE CAN SWAP OUT BOTTLES AND KEEP WORKING DURING PROLONGED EVENTS, 98 FACE PIECES. THIS WILL PROVIDE EVERY FIREFIGHTER WITH THEIR OWN PROPERLY FITTED MASS FOR HYGIENE AND SAFETY. FOR RAPID INTERVENTION TEAM PACKS, THESE ARE SPECIALIZED AIR SUPPLIES USED TO SOLELY RESCUE A DOWN FIREFIGHTER AND A FIT TESTING SYSTEM TO LEGALLY AND SAFELY CERTIFY THAT MASS SEAL CORRECTLY TO EACH FIREFIGHTERS FACE. WE SELECTED THIS PARTICULAR MSA G1 XR EDITION FOR THREE SPECIFIC STRATEGIC REASONS. FIRST, SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE. I'M PROUD TO REPORT THAT JUPITER FIRE RESCUE WILL BE ONE OF THE FIRST AGENCIES TO FIELD AIRPAC CERTIFIED TO THE 2025 EDITION OF THE NFPA 1970 STANDARD. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE LATEST SAFETY BENCHMARK IN THE INDUSTRY, ENSURING OUR DEPARTMENT STARTS OPERATIONS AT THE PINNACLE OF COMPLIANCE. SECOND, IS OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY. HISTORICALLY, COMMUNICATING WHILE WEARING A MASK INSIDE OF A FIRE HAS BEEN DIFFICULT. THESE NEW UNITS SOLVE THAT WITH INTEGRATED NOISE CANCELING, VOICE AMPLIFIERS, AND BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY DIRECTLY TO OUR RADIOS. OUR FIREFIGHTERS WILL BE ABLE TO HEAR AND BE HEARD CLEARLY EVEN IN HIGH NOISE ENVIRONMENTS. THIRD, IS FISCAL EFFICIENCY AND LONGEVITY. WE'RE PROPOSING TO PURCHASE THIS EQUIPMENT. UNDER A COMPETITIVE PIGGYBACK CONTRACT WITH LAKE COUNTY, FLORIDA THROUGH 108 FIRE AND SAFETY. THIS ENSURES THAT WE RECEIVE THE BEST AVAILABLE GOVERNMENT PRICING. FURTHERMORE, THESE UNITS WILL USE A CENTRAL RECHARGEABLE BATTERY SYSTEM ELIMINATING THE RECURRING COST OF PURCHASING THOUSANDS OF ALKALINE BATTERIES OVER THE LIFE OF THE UNITS. UNITS ARE DESIGNED WITH A 10 YEAR SERVICE LIFE AND THEY CAN BE UPDATED VIA SOFTWARE DURING THAT SERVICE LIFE, PREVENTING THEM FROM BECOMING OBSOLETE AS TECHNOLOGY EVOLVES. THIS ACQUISITION IS NOT JUST ABOUT BUYING GEAR. IT'S ABOUT ENSURING THAT WHEN OUR FIREFIGHTERS ANSWER A CALL IN 2026, THEY HAVE THE SAFEST, MOST RELIABLE TECHNOLOGY PROTECTING THEM SO THEY CAN PROTECT OTHERS. NEXT ON THE AGENDA FOR US IN THIS UPDATE IS OUR RECRUITING AND HIRING. YESTERDAY, THE TOWN BEGAN RECRUITING AND HIRING FOR OUR OPERATIONAL PERSONNEL. WE POSTED A JOB ANNOUNCEMENT FOR 12 FIRE RESCUE CAPTAINS AND 12 FIRE RESCUE LIEUTENANTS. BOTH WITH AN ANTICIPATED START DATE OF MAY 11 OF 2026. I'M HAPPY TO REPORT IN JUST THE FIRST 24 HOURS OF THAT POSTING. WE HAVE 40 APPLICANTS FOR CAPTAIN AND 37 APPLICANTS FOR LIEUTENANT. IN THE COMING WEEKS, WE'LL POST OUR JOB ANNOUNCEMENT FOR DRIVER ENGINEERS, ALSO WITH A START DATE OF MAY 11. IN THE BEGINNING OF JANUARY, WE'LL BEGIN ADVERTISING FOR OUR 54 FIREFIGHTER EMT OR FIREFIGHTER PARAMEDIC POSITIONS, ALL WITH AN ANTICIPATED START DATE OF JUNE 1ST, 2026. WE'RE EXCITED AND ANXIOUS TO GET OUR ENTIRE TEAM ON BOARD AND TO ESTABLISH THE BEACON OF EXCELLENCE FOR THE FIRE SERVICE RIGHT HERE IN JUPITER. ON THIS AGENDA FOR LATER IN THE MEETING IS A SPECIAL EXCEPTION AND SITE PLAN AMENDMENT APPLICATION FOR THE TEMPORARY FIRE STATION. I'LL ADDRESS THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION SITE PLAN AMENDMENT APPLICATION DURING THAT PART OF THE MEETING. RIGHT NOW, MY GOAL IS JUST TO EXPLAIN WHY WE NEED THIS TEMPORARY FIRE STATION AND HOW WE'LL BE OPERATING FROM IT. THE ABACOA FIRE STATION, ALSO KNOWN AS STATION 16, IS LOCATED ON MILITARY TRAIL JUST NORTH OF FREDERICK SMALL ROAD. PALMACH COUNTY FIRE RESCUE IS CURRENTLY USING THIS STATION TO PROVIDE SERVICE. THE STATION WILL REVERT TO THE TOWN'S OWNERSHIP UNDER A REVERSIONARY DEED, BUT THAT DEED PROVIDES FOR THE REVERSION TO OCCUR AT THE TIME THAT THE COUNTY NO LONGER PROVIDES SERVICE. WE'VE ATTEMPTED TO DEVELOP A PHASE TRANSITION PLAN THAT WOULD INCLUDE THE TRANSITION OF THE ABACOA STATION. THAT TRANSITION PLAN WAS DENIED. AS IT STANDS NOW, THE ABACOA FIRE STATION WILL REVERT TO THE TOWN'S OWNERSHIP ON OCTOBER 1ST OF 2026. BUT JUPITER FIRE RESCUE MUST BE OPERATIONAL THAT VERY SAME DAY. THIS FLIP OF A SWITCH APPROACH REQUIRES US TO ESTABLISH A TEMPORARY FIRE STATION FOR THE ABACOA AREA. OUR CURRENT PLAN IS TO PLACE A TEMPORARY FIRE STATION IN THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF THE ABACOA COMMUNITY PARK. AGAIN, WE'LL DISCUSS THIS FURTHER DURING THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION AND SITE PLAN AMENDMENT SECTION OF YOUR AGENDA TONIGHT. I'LL LEAVE YOU THIS AS ALWAYS, IN JUST A LITTLE OVER SIX MONTHS FROM TONIGHT. WE HAVE HIRED ALL OF OUR OPERATIONAL PERSONNEL, COMPLETED OUR NEW FIRE STATIONS. WE'LL HAVE ALL OF OUR APPARATUS AND EQUIPMENT IN PLACE, AND WE'LL BE PREPARING FOR THE TRANSITION OF SERVICES TO JUPITER FIRE RESCUE. IN A LITTLE OVER 10 MONTHS FROM TONIGHT, THE JUPITER FIRE RESCUE DEPARTMENT WILL BEGIN PROVIDING FULL FIRE AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY, AND JUPITER FIRE RESCUE REMAINS ON SCHEDULE AND ON BUDGET. I'LL TAKE ANY QUESTIONS IF YOU MIGHT HAVE THEM. >> ANY QUESTIONS? >> I JUST HAVE ONE, IF YOU DON'T MIND. OF THE 12 CAPTAINS AND 12 LIEUTENANTS, I ASSUME SINCE YOU'VE GOT SO MANY APPLICANTS SO FAR, I THINK YOU SAID 437, THOSE ARE ALL EXPERIENCE POSITIONS. >> THAT IS A REQUIREMENT TO APPLY FOR THOSE POSITIONS. THEY ALL REQUIRE PRIOR EXPERIENCE. >> THANK YOU. >> JUST CURIOUS. IT WAS VERY EFFECTIVE. THANK YOU FOR HAVING SOMEBODY MODEL THAT. WHAT IS THE WEIGHT ON THAT? I'M JUST CURIOUS. >> KEVIN MIGHT BE ABLE TO TELL US THAT. I DON'T KNOW, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. I CAN TELL YOU IT'S NOT LIGHT. MELISA HAS PUT ONE ON. SHE'LL TELL YOU. >> JUST CURIOUS. >> [INAUDIBLE] WHEN I FIRST GOT HIRED STEVE AND I DID THAT. I WAS LIKE SIX POUNDS. EVERY PART OF IT AND WE PUT IT ON A 64 POUNDS. >> THANK YOU. NOW FORTUNATELY, YOU ONLY PUT THAT ON WHEN YOU HAVE TO FIGHT FIRES, CORRECT? >> YES, SIR. >> BECAUSE I KNOW THAT OUR POLICE, THEY WEAR A VEST AND OTHER STUFF THAT'S OVER 20 POUNDS. THAT'S 8 HOURS A DAY. >> YOU'RE IN DIFFICULT BREATHING CONDITIONS, AND THEN YOU FIND SOMEONE TO RESCUE AND YOU'RE CARRYING THEM AS WELL. >> I JUST HAVE A QUESTION. WITH YOUR HIRING, DO YOU GIVE ANY PRIORITY TO MILITARY OR VETERANS? >> ABSOLUTELY. THERE'S VERY STRICT STATE LAWS AND STANDARDS ON THAT ISSUE. THANKFULLY, THAT'S ALL WELL BEYOND ME, BUT WE HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE HR DEPARTMENT WHO HANDLES ALL OF THAT FORCE. THEY HANDLE ALL THE SCREENING. THEY HANDLE ALL THE VETERANS PREFERENCE POINTS, AND THEY DO A TREMENDOUS JOB. SHOUT OUT TO THEM FOR HELPING US GET THESE ANNOUNCEMENTS OUT ON TIME, EXACTLY AS WE NEED THEM. IT'S A HEAVY LIFT. THERE'S A LOT OF LEGAL THINGS TO GO INTO HIRING. WE HAVE A REALLY JAM UP HR TEAM WHO IS DOING A GREAT JOB FOR US. >> JUST ONE LAST QUESTION. WITH ALL OF THE HIRING AND BRINGING THEM ON BOARD, YOU'RE STILL STAYING WITHIN BUDGET PRIOR TO OCTOBER. >> ABSOLUTELY. >> THANK YOU. >> CHIEF, JUST ONE QUESTION REGARDING THE REQUIRED EXPERIENCE. DO THE APPLICANTS NEED TO BE AT THE CURRENT RANK NOW THAT THEY'RE APPLYING FOR WITH US? >> THEY WILL NEED TO HAVE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF YEARS OF EXPERIENCE DEPENDING ON POSITION AND ALL OF THEM DEPEND ON THE DIFFERENT POSITIONS. THEN THEY WILL NEED TO HAVE EITHER SERVED IN THAT RANK, EITHER IN A STEP UP, LIKE AN ACTING CAPACITY OR IN A PROMOTED CAPACITY IN THE PAST. >> THANK YOU. >> I JUST WANT TO SHARE SOMETHING. I WAS QUITE SURPRISED. MY FAMILY AND I, WE HAD A GATHERING IN ORLANDO TWO WEEKENDS AGO. ON THE WAY UP, WE STOPPED AT A PUBLIX. MY WIFE HAD PRE ORDERED A BIRTHDAY CAKE FROM MY OLDEST DAUGHTER. SHE'S IN GETTING A CAKE, AND I'M WALKING OUTSIDE AND IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO NOTICE UNTIL I SAW THE FIRE TRUCK GO. BUT THERE WAS A TEMPORARY STATION THAT WAS IN A PUBLIC SHOPPING CENTER. IT'S ORANGE COUNTY STATION 32. MAYBE YOU KNOW ABOUT IT. WENT BACK BECAUSE I SAW A TRUCK COMING BACK, SO THEY HAD A YOU WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN IT WAS IN A SHOPPING CENTER OR OTHER IT DID HAVE A RATHER LARGE SIGN UP TOP, BUT THEY BASICALLY TOOK A STOREFRONT. I GUESS THAT MUST BE THE SLEEPING QUARTERS, AND HE HAD TWO, I'D CALL THE METAL BUILDINGS WHERE THEY STORED THE AMBULANCE AND THE FIRE TRUCK. I HAPPENED TO ENGAGE IN A CONVERSATION WITH ONE OF THE FIREMEN WALKING AROUND BACK. TWO THINGS STRUCK ME. NUMBER 1, HE SAID IT WAS A TEMPORARY STATION OR FLY GETTING THEIR STATION, BUT THEN HE QUICKLY SAID, BUT WE'VE BEEN IN THIS TEMPORARY STATION FOR 18 YEARS [LAUGHTER]. ANYWAY. BUT THEN, OF COURSE, JUST STRIKING UP A CONVERSATION. APPARENTLY, HE WAS WELL FAMILIAR WITH JUPITER AS ONE WOULD EXPECT STARTING UP A FIRE DEPARTMENT, BUT I'M JUST DELIGHTED AS A POINT OF PERSPECTIVE. IT WAS SO STUNNING TO SEE THAT IN A SHOPPING CENTER, AND IT WASN'T IT WAS DONE RIGHT WERE ON THE TOP, BUT I WASN'T LOOKING UP BECAUSE I WAS WALKING ALONG THE SIDEWALK. BUT 18 YEARS. I'M GLAD THAT WE'RE ENDING UP WITH THE RIGHT FIRE STATION RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX, AND WE'RE GOING TO BE GETTING IT TEMPORARY ONLY AS A TRANSITION UNTIL WE GO AHEAD AND ARE ABLE TO TAKE POSSESSION AND REFURBISH AS REQUIRED, THE EXISTING ABACOA STATION. I JUST THOUGHT I'D SHARE THAT WITH YOU ANYWAY. I WAS INTERESTING WHAT'S THE CHANCES OF ME COMING ACROSS [LAUGHTER]. THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. APPRECIATE IT. >> THANK YOU. >> MOVING ON TO CITIZEN COMMENTS. THIS IS FOR NON AGENDA ITEMS. ANYBODY WISHING TO SPEAK IS ASKED TO STATE HIS OR HER NAME FOR AN ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD PRIOR TO ADDRESSING TOWN COUNCIL. WE DON'T GENERALLY RESPOND TO THE ITEMS. IT'S REFERRED TO STAFF TO FOLLOW UP. WITH THAT, I BELIEVE WE HAVE A COUPLE OF PUBLIC COMMENTS? >> YES, SIR. WE HAVE THREE COMMENT CARDS. WE HAVE JOE SPANO, FOLLOWED BY CHRISTIE PANEO, FOLLOWED BY PETER LEO. >> GOOD EVENING. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. MY NAME IS JOE SPANO. I LIVE AT 1603 KINGSLEY ROAD. I'VE BEEN HERE IN THIS TOWN FOR JUST ABOUT 50 YEARS, ME AND MY LOVELY WIFE WHO WAS RIGHT THERE BEHIND ME. BACK WHEN I FIRST MOVED INTO TOWN, THERE WERE FOUR POLICE OFFICERS, WHICH WE'RE THANKFUL FOR. THERE WERE 365 KIDS IN MY GRADUATING CLASS, AND THERE WAS LESS THAN 29 THAN PEOPLE IN JUPITER. IT'S CHANGED QUITE A BIT SINCE I MOVED HERE. WE GREW UP ON JUPITER ISLAND. IF I KNEW THEN, WHAT I KNOW NOW, I WOULD HAVE RAN FOR A COUNCIL AND THE ONLY THING I WOULD HAVE PUSHED FOR IS THAT YOU CAN'T COME TO MY TOWN AND SAY, WHAT A BEAUTIFUL SLICE OF PARADISE, WHAT A WONDERFUL PIECE OF HEAVEN, THIS PLACE IS AMAZING. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED? YOU NEED THIS. NO, WE DON'T. WE DON'T NEED A CVS ON EVERY CORNER. WE DON'T NEED A WALGREENS ON EVERY CORNER. I'M UP IN MAPS VINEYARD A DOZEN TIMES A YEAR. THEY DON'T HAVE A WALMART. WE DON'T NEED A WALMART. WE DON'T NEED ALL THESE BLUE NEON SIGNS. YOU GUYS ARE PUSHING FOR ALL THIS CONSTRUCTION. THERE'S NOT ONE PUBLIC BOAT DOCK OR TOWN BOAT DOCK LIKE RIVERA BEACH, STUART OR FORT PIERCE FOR US LOCALS, TO PUT OUR BOAT IN. IT'S JUST ALL THIS DEVELOPMENT. MAYBE SOME OF THE MONEY THAT'S BEING TAKEN AND SPENT SHOULD BUY SUNI SANDS BACK AND MAKE THAT A PARK FOR OUR KIDS AND OUR GRAND-KIDS. THAT'S HOW YOU GUYS CAN MAKE A LEGACY. THAT'S HOW YOU CAN PUT A MARK ON JUPITER. I'VE BEEN HERE FOR 50 YEARS, THE FOUNDING FATHERS, THE PIONEER FAMILIES. THEY ABSOLUTELY WOULD BE ROLLING IN THEIR GRAVE. ALL OF THESE STORAGE FACILITIES THAT YOU GUYS CONDONE. THE FACT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO ALLOW BUILDING NEXT TO GUANABANAS, AND THAT PARK WITH THE FLOATING DOCK THAT US LOCALS COME TO, TO GO WALK AROUND TO SEE THE RESTAURANTS IS GOING TO BE GONE BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BRING MORE PEOPLE IN. I WOULD HAVE RAN FOR A COUNCIL AND I WOULD HAVE SAID, YOU CAN'T COME TO THIS TOWN AND RUN FOR THE BOARD, AND THE COUNCIL UNLESS YOU'RE A 20 OR 30-YEAR RESIDENT. BECAUSE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND FROM MY EYES, FROM MY HEART, WHAT I SEE HAPPENING. MY WIFE AND I GO TO PUBLICS, WE KNOW NOBODY. DO YOU REMEMBER THE COMMERCIAL WITH THE INDIAN ON THE HORSE WITH THE TEAR RUNNING DOWN HIS EYES? I WEAR MY SUNGLASSES, ONE TO HIDE MY AGE, AND TWO, TO HIDE THE TEARS BECAUSE YOU GUYS JUST WANT TO MAKE THIS FULL OF PEOPLE. YOU'RE TURNING IT INTO A METROPOLIS. YOU GOT TO STEP BACK. YOU GOT TO THINK OF YOUR KIDS. YOU GOT TO THINK OF YOUR GRANDKIDS. IT'S WONDERFUL TO HAVE A NEW FIRE STATION. I DON'T REMEMBER I'VE BEEN HERE 50 YEARS WHEN WE'VE HAD A MAJOR FIRE. PALM BEACH COUNTY WAS FINE. I'M NOT GOING TO DISCOUNT THAT BECAUSE IT'S DONE, BUT MAKE A PARK, MAKE A BOAT RAMP, DO SOMETHING FOR YOUR CHILDREN, SOMETHING FOR YOUR GRANDCHILDREN. THIS IS RIDICULOUS. WE NEED THIS. [APPLAUSE] WE DIDN'T BEFORE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME, AND THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SPEAK. I WILL SPEAK ON OTHER SUBJECTS AT DIFFERENT TIMES. DON'T HOLD MY OPINION AGAINST ME. IT'S JUST MY VIEW FROM A HURT LOCAL. [APPLAUSE] >> CHRISTY PINELA. >> HI. MY NAME IS CHRISTY PINELA. I LIVE AT 48292 QUESTA DRIVE, AND I'M ALSO THE OWNER AND OPERATOR OF JUPITER INLET BOAT RENTALS, WHICH OPERATES OUT OF U-TIKI MARINA. WE ARE A FAMILY BUSINESS THAT'S BEEN IN BUSINESS, SAME LOCATION, SAME SPOT, STARTED BY MY FATHER AND MY UNCLE, GOING ON 27 YEARS NOW. WHAT WE DO IS WE PROVIDE THE ONLY PUBLIC ACCESS FOR BOATS ON THE WATER, THE TOWN OF JUPITER. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A MEMBER TO RENT A BOAT, WE RENT BOATS THE GENERAL PUBLIC. IF TOURIST VISITORS COME DOWN FOR A WEEK, THEY WANT TO GET ON THE WATER, EXPLORE THE BEAUTIFUL WATER OF JUPITER, WE ARE THE ONLY PLACE THAT RENTS BOATS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. WE DON'T DO THAT BECAUSE IT MAKES US MORE MONEY. WE DO IT BECAUSE PERSONALLY, YOU FEEL LIKE IT'S NECESSARY THING TO HAVE PUBLIC ACCESS TO THE WATER. TRUST ME, PUBLIC RENTALS ARE GIGANTIC HEADACHE, WAY MORE DIFFICULT AND LESS MONEY AND THEN THAN DOING PRIVATE BOAT CLUBS AND MARINAS. OUR ETHICALLY PUBLIC RENTALS ARE WHAT WE FEEL WE SHOULD DO. UNFORTUNATELY, UNLESS SOMETHING DRASTIC HAPPENS QUICKLY, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SHUT DOWN AND CLOSE DUE TO THE FACT THAT WE CAN'T AFFORD TO STAY AT THE MARINA THERE ANYMORE, AND THERE'S NO OTHER OPTIONS AVAILABLE. WHEN THE BRIDGE WENT DOWN, WE RIGHT OFF THE BAT, LOST 40% OF OUR BUSINESS. THAT'S FINE. WE CAN EAT THAT. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, OUR LANDLORD DOUBLED OUR RENT TO $250,000 A YEAR. OVERNIGHT, DOUBLED THE RENT, SAME TIME THE BRIDGE WENT DOWN. NEW OWNER. WE'VE TRIED TO SIT IT OUT, WAIT FOR IT, UNFORTUNATELY, WE JUST CAN'T AFFORD IT, AND HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR A DIFFERENT PLACE TO MOVE TO. THERE'S A LACK OF COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE PUBLIC DOCKS THAT CAN FIT A FLEET OF TEN BOATS. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS MARINEMAX, WHO IS AT THE MARINA. THEY'RE A PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANY ON THE STOCK MARKET, EQUIVALENT OF WALMART'S OF BOATS. THEY'RE OFFERING MORE MONEY, THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE OVER OUR SPOT. THE LANDLORD IS GOING TO GIVE THEM OUR DOCKS, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. WHEN WE LEAVE, THE TOWN WILL LOSE THE ONLY PUBLIC ACCESS TO THE WATER FOR BOATERS. WE DON'T WANT TO CLOSE DOWN, WE'D LIKE TO MOVE TO A NEW LOCATION. CAN'T FIND ONE. THERE WON'T BE A SPOT FOR TOURIST, VISITORS, ANYBODY TO RENT A BOAT TO GET IN THE WATER. I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT'S GOING TO HURT VISITORS, TOURISM AND JUPITER. FIFTY PERCENT OF OUR BUSINESS STORES, 50% ARE LOCALS. THAT ACCESS IS GOING TO BE GONE TO JUPITER, AND JUPITER IS KNOWN FOR ITS WATER. THE INLET VILLAGE, THE GOAL IS TO SUPPORT LOCAL BUSINESSES, THINGS LIKE THAT. I WOULD REALLY LIKE SOME SUPPORT IF THERE'S ANY WAY TO DO A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP, MAYBE THE DOCKS BY GUANABANAS, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. BUT AFTER 27 YEARS, MONTH LEASE, WE'VE GOT TO BE OUT IN TWO WEEKS. WHEN WE GO, THERE GOES THE PUBLIC ACCESS TO BOATING IN JUPITER. THE TOWN WILL GREATLY LOSE OUT, AND JUST WANT TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY WAY TO ANY THING WITH A CRA, SOMETHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE I BELIEVE WE'RE THE TYPE OF BUSINESS YOU GUYS LOOK TO SUPPORT. WE GIVE BACK TO THE TOWN. HAPPY TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT IF POSSIBLE. THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] >> CAPTAIN PETER LEO. >> GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS CAPTAIN PETE LEO. I LIVE AT HARBOR ROAD NORTH. I'VE BEEN LIVING IN JUPITER FOR 53 YEARS. I WORKED 35 YEARS FOR PALM BEACH COUNTY PARKS AND RECREATION DEPARTMENT AS AN OCEAN LIFEGUARD HERE ON THE JUPITER BEACHES, MAINLY AROUND THE JUPITER INLET. THIS IS A BIT OF A REPEAT PERFORMANCE OF OUR LAST TWO COMMENTS, BUT I SEEK THE COUNCIL TO CONSIDER A RESOLUTION OF SUPPORT TO CONSIDER A AFFORDABLE TOWN DOCK IN MARINA SOMEWHERE IN THE JUPITER WATERWAYS. I BELIEVE EVENTUALLY, IT COULD BE BUILT SOMEWHERE. THERE'S NOT TOO MANY CHOICES, LIKE THEY SAID EARLIER, BURT-REYNOLDS DOCKS AND RAMPS IS A POTENTIAL LOCATION. SUNI SANDS MIGHT BE ANOTHER POTENTIAL LOCATION. SAWFISH BAY IS ANOTHER POTENTIAL LOCATION. THE REASON WHY I'M SO CONCERNED ABOUT THIS IS BECAUSE EVERYTHING ELSE HAS BEEN PRIVATIZED AND UNAFFORDABLE FOR THE BLUE COLLAR LOCAL BOATER TO FIND DOCKAGE. LOCK STOCK AND BARREL. IT'S ROUGH OUT THERE. THAT'S BASICALLY ALL I WANTED TO ASK THE TOWN TO CONSIDER. THAT RESOLUTION OF SUPPORT TO CONSIDER A TOWN AFFORDABLE DOCK IN MARINA. THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] ANY OTHERS? >> NO OTHER SPEAKERS. >> MOVING ON TO THE MINUTES. COUNCIL WE HAVE BEFORE US THE MINUTES TO THE DECEMBER 2 MEETING, AND THERE'S SOME MINOR ADDITIONS ON THE DAIS. THERE'S NO FURTHER ADDITIONS. NO CORRECTIONS. I'LL TAKE A MOTION AND A SECOND TO ADOPT THE MINUTES AS AMENDED. >> MOTION TO ADOPT THE MINUTES? >> SECOND. >> ALL IN FAVOR SIGNIFY BY SAYING AYE? >> AYE. >> AYE. >> AYE. >> MOTION CARRIES UNANIMOUSLY. MOVING ON TO THE CONSENT AGENDA. THIS IS ITEMS 3 THROUGH 6. IS THERE ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC THAT WISH TO PULL THE CONSENT AGENDA ITEM? >> NO, SIR. >> ANY MEMBER ON THE DAIS WISHES TO PULL A CONSENT AGENDA ITEM? SEEING NONE. WE HAVE ONE ITEM WHICH IS QUASI-JUDICIAL. DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY QUASI-JUDICIAL DISCLOSURES FOR ORDINANCE 2025? I HAVE NONE. >> NONE. >> NONE. >> SEEING NONE, I'LL TAKE A MOTION IN A SECOND. >> SO MOVED. >> SECOND. >> I'D ASK FOR ORDINANCES 17-25 AND ORDINANCE 20-25 TO BE READ. >> MAYOR, WE NEED TO TAKE THEM INDIVIDUALLY, BUT I'LL READ ORDINANCE 17-25 SINCE IT'S FIRST. AN ORDINANCE OF THE TOWN COUNCIL OF TOWN OF JUPITER, FLORIDA, AMENDING THE TOWN CODE TO CREATE DIVISION 17.1 ENTITLED RECREATION DISTRICT TO ESTABLISH USES BY RIGHT, ACCESSORY USES, AND SPECIAL EXCEPTION USES, PROVIDING FOR SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS, PROVIDING FOR SEVERABILITY, PROVIDING FOR THE APPEALS OF LAWS IN CONFLICT, AND PROVIDING FOR AN EFFECTIVE DATE. >> YOU INDICATE THOSE NEED TO BE TAKEN SEPARATELY? >> YES, MAYOR. >> I'LL TAKE A NEW MOTION TO APPROVE ORDINANCE 17-25. >> MOTION MOVED, SECOND. >> MOTION A SECOND. ALL THOSE IN FAVOR SIGNIFY BY SAYING AYE? >> AYE. >> AYE. >> AYE. MOTION CARRIES UNANIMOUSLY. I'LL TAKE A MOTION IN A SECOND TO ADOPT FOR ORDINANCE 20-25 ON FIRST READING. >> GO AHEAD. >> MOTION TO APPROVE ORDINANCE 20-25. >> I'LL SECOND. >> MOTION IN THE SECOND. I ASKED FOR IT TO BE READ. >> ORDINANCE 20-25 AND ORDINANCE OF THE TOWN COUNCIL, TOWN OF JUPITER, FLORIDA, AMENDING THE TOWN'S OFFICIAL ZONING MAP TO RE-ZONE 1.19 ACRES OF PROPERTY LOCATED AT 100 AND 102 NORTH COASTAL WAY FROM THE INDIAN TOWN ROAD OVER THE ZONING DISTRICT, US HIGHWAY 1 DISTRICT, WITH UNDERLYING GENERAL COMMERCIAL C2 TO US HIGHWAY 1 INTRACOASTAL WATERWAY, CORRIDOR DISTRICT, WATERWAY, COMMERCIAL AND ENTERTAINMENT SUB-DISTRICT, PROVIDING FOR SEVERABILITY, PROVIDING FOR APPEAL OF LAWS IN CONFLICT AND PROVIDING FOR AN EFFECTIVE DATE. >> HAVE A MOTION IN A SECOND.

I'LL TAKE A MOTION IN A SECOND TO APPROVE THE CONSENT AGENDA CONSISTENT OF AGENDA ITEMS 5 AND 6. >> I'LL MAKE A MOTION TO APPROVE. >> SECOND. >> MOTION IN A SECOND. ALL THOSE IN FAVOR SIGNIFY BY SAYING AYE. >> AYE. >> MOTION CARRIES UNANIMOUSLY. NOW I WOULD JUST ASK THE TOWN CLERK TO CHANGE THE WORDING UNDER THE CONSENT AGENDA. FIRST TIME, I CAN RECOLLECT THE GUIDANCE, BUT I APPRECIATE THE GUIDANCE BECAUSE THIS SAYS THAT WE ENACTED EVERYTHING ON THE CONSENT IN ONE MOTION. HOWEVER, GET WITH TOWN ATTORNEY, WHATEVER THE GUIDANCE IS THAT ORDINANCES ARE DONE SEPARATELY IF THERE'S MORE THAN ONE. >> YES, SIR. WE'LL MAKE THAT CHANGE. >> THEN I KNOW CLEARLY WHAT THE GUIDELINES ARE. THANK YOU. MOVING ON TO REGULAR AGENDA. WE HAVE A PUBLIC HEARING ON RESOLUTION 12125. THIS IS QUASI-JUDICIAL. I WOULD ASK THOSE EXPECTING TO POSSIBLY PROVIDE TESTIMONY TO BE STAND AND SWORN IN. >> DO YOU SOLEMNLY SWEAR THAT THE TESTIMONY YOU'RE ABOUT TO GIVE IN THIS HEARING IS THE WHOLE TRUTH, AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH? >> THIS IS A QUASI-JUDICIAL HEARING. I'D ASK IF ANYBODY HAS ANY EXPERT DISCLOSURES. I DID HAVE Q&A WITH STAFF ABOUT TEMPORARY PARKING CHANGES. ANY OTHERS? >> NO. >> I VISITED THE SITE, AND I SPOKE WITH STAFF. >> I VISITED THE SITE ALSO. >> I FREQUENTLY VISIT THE SITE ON PICK UP TIME. OCTOBER NOVEMBER. THE STAFF FOR THE PRESENTATION. >> GOOD EVENING AGAIN. ON OCTOBER 1ST OF 2026, THE JUPITER FIRE RESCUE DEPARTMENT WILL BEGIN PROVIDING FULL FIRE AND EMS SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY. THE ABACOA FIRE STATION, CURRENTLY LOCATED ON MILITARY TRAIL JUST NORTH OF FREDERICK SMALL ROAD, WILL REVERT TO TOWN OWNERSHIP ON OCTOBER 1ST OF 2026, BUT JUPITER FIRE RESCUE MUST BE OPERATIONAL THAT SAME DAY. THIS REQUIRES US TO ESTABLISH A TEMPORARY FIRE STATION FOR THE ABACOA AREA. WE WILL RUN CALLS FROM THIS TEMPORARY FIRE STATION ONLY UNTIL WE COMPLETE ANY REQUIRED MODIFICATIONS IN THE EXISTING ABACOA FIRE STATION AND MOVE OUR FURNISHINGS AND EQUIPMENT IN. THIS TEMPORARY STATION WILL ENSURE CONTINUITY OF SERVICE IN RAPID RESPONSE TIMES TO JUPITER'S RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES. THIS IS A SITE PLAN SHOWING THE LOCATION THAT WE INTEND TO PLACE THIS TEMPORARY FIRE STATION. WE'LL OCCUPY THIS TEMPORARY FIRE STATION BEGINNING IN JUNE OF 2026 AS A TRAINING BASE. WE HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY TO KEEP THEM INFORMED OF OUR INTENT, TO ANSWER ANY OF THEIR QUESTIONS. WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH ALL THE SURROUNDING HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS, THE TOWN'S RECREATION DEPARTMENT, ROGER DEAN STADIUM, AND INDEPENDENCE MIDDLE SCHOOL NEXT DOOR ON OUR PLANS TO PROVIDE SERVICE FROM THE STATION UP UNTIL WE CAN TRANSITION TO THE ABACOA STATION ON MILITARY TRAIL. WE DO RECOGNIZE THE SIGNIFICANT TRAFFIC CHALLENGES THAT EXIST DURING THE MORNING DROP OFF AND AFTERNOON PICK UP TIMES AS GREENWAY DRIVE OFTEN BECOMES IMPASSABLE OR VERY SLOW MOVING. CONGESTION IS HEAVIEST FROM THAT 9:10 AM TO 9:25 AM. THAT'S FOR THE 9:30 INDEPENDENCE MIDDLE SCHOOL START TIME. THEN AGAIN, IN THE AFTERNOON FROM 3:30-4:20 FOR THEIR 4:05 DISMISSAL TIME. TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS, OUR FIREFIGHTERS AND THEIR UNITS WILL BE MOVING TO ANOTHER AREA TO STAGE FOR ANY CALLS DURING THESE TIME PERIODS WHILE WE ARE RUNNING CALLS FROM THAT STATION. THE CURRENT PLAN IS TO RELOCATE THE TEMPORARY STATION TO THE ABACOA COMMUNITY PARK SITE, SOMETIME IN JANUARY OF 2026. IN MARCH OF 26, THEY WILL INSTALL A CANOPY FOR FIRE VEHICLES AND A SHED FOR TURNOUT GEAR, AND BY MAY OF 2026, THE TEMPORARY STATION WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED AND READY FOR US TO WORK OUT OF, AND WE PLAN TO OCCUPY IT IN JUNE OF 2026. I'LL TURN IT OVER TO GARRETT FOR THE SITE PLAN AMENDMENT COMPONENTS. >> GOOD EVENING, COUNSEL FOR THE RECORD, GARRET WATSON WITH PLANNING AND ZONING. THIS SLIDE SHOWS YOU THE LAYOUT OF THE TEMPORARY FIRE STATION. THE VERTICAL STRUCTURE IS THE ACTUAL TEMPORARY STATION. THERE'S A CANOPY FOR JFRD VEHICLES THAT'S TO PROVIDE PROTECTION, WEATHER PROTECTION FROM THEM, AS WELL AS AN EQUIPMENT SHED ON SITE. FEW MODIFICATIONS ARE BEING MADE TO THE SITE IN TERMS OF LANDSCAPING. THERE'S A REQUIREMENT FOR A CONTINUOUS HEDGE, A COCOA PLUM HEDGE TO BE ALONG THE SIDEWALK IN THE ROAD AND THAT JUST PROVIDES FOR BUFFERING FROM THE ROADWAY INTO THE PARK. THAT'S THE CURRENT PLAN THAT'S SHOWN ON THE LEFT SIDE OF YOUR SCREEN. THERE'S SOME ROOM FOR ADJUSTMENT AS NEEDED FOR ANY PIECES THERE, BUT THAT'S THE CURRENT LAYOUT. IN ADDITION TO THAT, THERE IS IN BLUE, IN RED UP AGAINST THE BUILDING. THERE'S SOME POTTED CLUSIA THAT'S GOING TO BE ADDED AROUND THE BASE OF THE TEMPORARY STATION. THAT'S TO PROVIDE SOME SCREENING FOR THE SKIRTING OF THE BUILDING AND JUST MAKE SURE THAT IT COMPLIES WITH THE INTENT OF FOUNDATION PLANTING TO BEAUTIFY THE BASE OF THE BUILDING. THAT POTTED CLUSIA WILL MAINTAIN ON SITE UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE STATION IS REMOVED, AT WHICH POINT WE CAN PLANT THAT CLUSIA ELSEWHERE. THERE'S ANYTHING IN THE AREA THAT NEEDS SCREENING, WE CAN MOVE IT THERE. HOPEFULLY IT'S NICE AND HEALTHY AND FULL AND CAN PLANTED AND PROVIDE SOME INSTANT SCREENING THERE. IN ADDITION TO WHAT'S GOING IN AROUND THE STATION, GENERAL PARK LANDSCAPING IS GOING TO BE ENHANCED OR INSTALLING SOME COCOA PLUM, CAHACHI GRASS, AND SOME LEX PLANTED THROUGHOUT THE PARK, AS WELL AS ON THE FREDRICK SMALL ENTRANCE. THAT JUST PROVIDES SOME BEAUTIFICATION AND HELPS MEET TOWN CODE STANDARDS. THERE'S TWO CONDITIONS IN RESOLUTION 12125 FOR YOU TONIGHT. THE FIRST IS THAT THE TEMPORARY STATIONS REMOVED WITHIN 60 DAYS OF A CERTIFICATE OF COMPLETION FOR RENOVATIONS. THE PURPOSE OF THAT IS REALLY JUST TO SIGNIFY TO THE PUBLIC, THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE, THAT THE INTENT IS WHENEVER THAT STATION IS NO LONGER OPERATIONALLY NECESSARY TO TRY TO BEGIN THE MOVE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. THAT JUST GIVES A TIME FRAME FOR US TO WORK WITHIN AND GIVES THE PUBLIC SOME ASSURANCE THAT THE GOAL IS TO MOVE IT OFF SITE AND RESTORE THAT AREA TO HOW IT EXISTS TODAY AS SOON AS THAT STATION IS NO LONGER OPERATIONALLY NECESSARY. LASTLY, WE HAVE A CONDITION FOR WATER CONNECTION FEES. IT'S VERY STANDARD. YOU'VE SEEN THAT IN ALMOST EVERY SITE PLAN YOU'VE REVIEWED. IN TERMS OF THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION AND SITE PLAN CRITERIA, STAFF HAS FOUND THAT THE APPLICATION MEETS ALL CRITERIA WITH THE RECOMMENDED CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, WE FIND THAT IT MEETS ALL SPECIAL EXCEPTION CRITERIA. THE PROPOSED FIRE STATION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN AND THE TOWN CODE. IT'S COMPATIBLE WITH THE CHARACTER OF THE SURROUNDING AREA THAT IT SERVES, AND IT'S AN INTEGRATED AND ESSENTIAL PART OF ANY COMMUNITY. IN CONCLUSION, THE TEMPORARY STATION, AS THE CHIEF MENTIONED, WILL ENSURE THE CONTINUITY OF SERVICE FOR JUPITER'S RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES. IT'S GOING TO BE REMOVED AS SOON AS IT'S NO LONGER OPERATIONALLY NECESSARY, AND THE CONDITION ENSURES THAT AND GIVES THE PUBLIC ASSURANCE OF THAT. THE TOWN HAS BEEN COMMUNICATING AS CHIEF MENTIONED WITH ALL SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOODS, INCLUDING THE RESIDENTS, AND THE PRINCIPAL OF INDEPENDENCE MIDDLE SCHOOL, ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR THE TEMPORARY STATION. YOU PLANNING AND ZONING COMMISSION RECOMMENDED APPROVAL OF THIS APPLICATION IS BEFORE YOU TONIGHT IN RESOLUTION 12115. I'M GOING TO LEAVE YOU HERE WITH JUST A RENDERING FROM THAT PARKING LOT, LOOKING AT THE UNIT. THIS IS LOOKING FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE PARKING LOT TOWARDS GREENWAY DRIVE IS IN THE BACKGROUND. YOU CAN SEE THE CANOPIES ON THE LEFT AND THE TEMPORARY STATION IS ON THE MIDDLE THERE WITH THE ACCESS RAMP. I'LL LEAVE IT THERE AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. >> TURNING TO COUNCIL THERE, ANYBODY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS TO STAFF? >> NOT AT THIS POINT. >> I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. YOU SAID THAT THE APPARATUS MIGHT BE MOVING DURING SCHOOL DROP OFF AND PICK UP. WHAT WHERE IN THE PARK OR WHAT EXIT ARE THEY TAKING OR WHERE WILL THEY GO FOR THOSE? >> DURING THOSE MORNING PICK UP AND AFTERNOON DISMISSAL TIMES, IT IS OUR INTENT TO MOVE OUR APPARATUS AWAY FROM THE PARK, AND OUR PLAN AT THIS POINT IS BECAUSE THIS IS WHEN WE'RE RUNNING CALLS, OCTOBER 1 ON. THE ABACOA FIRE STATION ON MILITARY TRAIL WILL HAVE REVERTED TO OUR OWNERSHIP, BUT WE'LL BE FINALIZING ANY MODIFICATIONS OF MOVING EQUIPMENT AND WE HAVE ACCESS TO THAT SITE, AND THAT'S THE SITE THAT WE PLAN TO MOVE OUR VEHICLES TO TO RUN CALLS FROM. >> THE SHED AND THE COVERINGS FOR THE STRUCTURES, THEY'RE ALL CATEGORY FIVE RATED, IS THAT? >> THE SHED AND THE STRUCTURES, I HONESTLY COULDN'T TELL YOU THAT. I DON'T HAVE I DON'T HAVE ANY REAL DETAILS ON THAT. I KNOW THE TEMPORARY FIRE STATION ITSELF. IS CAT 5 RATED SECURED. >> WILL THE STRUCTURE BE SECURED TO THE GROUND THE PAVED AREA. THE PAVEMENT WILL BE FIXED AND RETURNED IN BETTER CONDITION? >> THAT'S CORRECT. >> THE TEACHER PARKING WHAT EXTENT DO TEACHERS USE THAT PARKING LOT? WHAT PERCENTAGE? >> WE'VE BEEN IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH INDEPENDENCE. POLICE DEPARTMENT AND FIRE DEPARTMENT WENT AND MET WITH THEM JUST TWO WEEKS AGO. WE MET WITH THE PRINCIPAL AGAIN. WE'VE SPOKEN WITH THEM PRIOR. RIGHT NOW, IN ANECDOTALLY, I'LL SAY WE'VE BEEN BY THERE NUMEROUS TIMES AND THEY'RE ONLY USING ABOUT MAYBE 30% OF THE PARKING THAT'S IN THAT AREA. MAYBE EVEN A LITTLE LESS. WE DO INTEND TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THEM THAT ANY UNUSED PARKING THAT WE DON'T HAVE OUR VEHICLES IN, THEY'LL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE THAT USE. THERE'S MORE THAN ENOUGH SPACES THAN THEY'RE CURRENTLY USING. >> THEN I KNOW YOU SPOKE WITH MY NEIGHBORHOOD AND YOU'VE CONTINUED TO SPEAK WITH NEIGHBORHOODS EVEN SINCE THE P&Z MEETING, BUT CAN YOU SHARE WHO YOU'VE SPOKEN WITH? I SAW THERE WAS CONCERN ABOUT WE TO REACH OUT TO ROGER DEAN AND JTA AS WELL. I JUST WANTED TO CONFIRM, HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO CONNECT WITH THOSE ORGANIZATIONS? >> SPOKEN WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE HEIGHTS, VALENCIA, ANTIGUA, TUSCANY. OF COURSE, INDEPENDENCE MIDDLE SCHOOL, THEIR PRINCIPAL, AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THEM, THE SCHOOL POLICE, AND OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT ALL TOGETHER COLLABORATIVELY. TRAFFIC IS REALLY A BIG ISSUE IN THAT AREA, WHICH IS A LAW ENFORCEMENT CONCERN, AND SO THEY'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN ALL OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS. ALSO WITH ROGER DEAN STADIUM, AS THEY USE A PART OF THE ABACO COMMUNITY PARK FOR SOME PARKING DURING SOME OF THEIR EVENTS. WE'VE BEEN COORDINATING WITH THEM AS WELL AS SPOKEN WITH FOLKS FROM JTAA. A POSITIVE CONVERSATIONS, ALL SUPPORTIVE CONVERSATIONS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THEM. >> THANK YOU. >> I'VE GOING BY A COUPLE OF TIMES COUNTED PARKING PLACES THERE AND NUMBER OF CARS FOR TEACHING THERE, AND YOU'RE RIGHT. IT'S ABOUT 30%. JUST LOOK AT THE SITE PLAN, IT LOOKS LIKE MAYBE A THIRD OF IT MIGHT BE OCCUPIED BY THE STATION AND THE EQUIPMENT AND THE CANOPIES AND THE SHED, AND EVERYTHING. THAT STILL LEAVES TWO THIRDS LEFT FOR THE TEACHERS. ONE QUESTION THOUGH. YOU SAY AFTER JANUARY UNTIL THE STATION PAMPER STATION IS REMOVED, THAT PARENTS WILL BE NO LONGER RE ALLOWED TO DROP OFF AND PICK UP THEIR KIDS AT THAT PARKING LOT, HAS THAT BEEN COMMUNICATED TO THE PARENTS? >> OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT, COMMUNITY RELATIONS DEPARTMENT ARE BOTH WORKING WITH INDEPENDENT SCHOOL INDEPENDENCE MIDDLE SCHOOL TO GET A MESSAGE OUT TO THE PARENTS THAT HAS NOT BEEN DONE YET. WE'RE WAITING FOR YOUR APPROVAL TONIGHT TO OFFICIALLY ALLOW US TO MOVE TO THAT POINT. AT THIS POINT, WE DON'T HAVE OFFICIAL APPROVAL TO USE THE SITE, AND SO ONCE YOU DO THAT TONIGHT, IF YOU DO, THEN WE'LL BE ABLE TO MOVE TO THAT NEXT STEP FOR COMMUNICATING WITH THE PUBLIC. >> PLANNING AND ZONING MAY HAVE LOOKED AT THIS, BUT ON YOUR CHART, PAGE 3, THAT SITE VIEW WITH THE STATION HERE, IT'S HEAVILY TREED AROUND THE PERIMETER ALONG GREENWAY AND EVERYTHING. HAVE WE LOOKED AT? CAN WE PHYSICALLY MOVE THE TEMPORARY STATION IN THERE WITHOUT HAVE REMOVE TREES TO GET ACCESS? >> WE HAVE HAD THE FOLKS THAT DO MOVE THE STATIONS COME LOOK AT THE SITE SO THEY'VE ASSURED US THEY CAN DO THIS. >> GOOD. I HAVE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. >> NOT A QUESTION, BUT JUST TO WEIGHING IN ABOUT THE CONVERSATION ABOUT TEACHER PARKING. I HAVE OCCASION TO BOTH DO A DROP OFF IN THE MORNING AND PICK UP IN THE AFTERNOON FOR MY GRANDSON. FIRST OF ALL, I THINK DROP OFF, GENERALLY, I WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT THE PARKING SPACES GET USED BECAUSE DROP OFF IS A MORE EFFICIENT PROCESS. I USE THE NOR SIDE BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST DRIVING THROUGH MOVES QUICKLY. >> PICK UP IS WHERE YOU'RE WAITING. I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN ALL OF THE SPACES USED. I WOULD SAY THAT AT LEAST HALF THE SPACES USED IN THAT ONE PARKING AREA ARE PEOPLE PICKING UP KIDS. I COULD SAY THAT JUST BY HAVING OBSERVED THAT FIRSTHAND. THEREIN, YOUR 30% OBSERVATION IS ON WITH CONSISTENT WITH ANYTHING I'VE EVER SEEN. I JUST PASSED THAT AS A SHARE. WITH THAT, WAS THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS ON THIS ONE? >> NO, SIR. >> NO. GOING BACK TO COUNSEL, ANY FINAL COMMENTS OR I'LL TAKE A MOTION IN A SECOND. I'LL MAKE A MOTION TO APPROVE RESOLUTION 121-25. >> SECOND. >> HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. ALL IN FAVOR, SIGNIFY BY SAYING AYE. >> AYE. >> MOTION CARRIES UNANIMOUSLY. MOVING ON TO PUBLIC BUSINESS ITEM, RESOLUTION 10425, APPROVING A CONTRACT FOR DEEP WELL INJECTION PHASE TWO IMPROVEMENTS. I'LL TURN IT OVER TO WHOEVER HIS STAFF IS KICKING THIS OFF. >> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND TOWN COUNCIL. FOR THE RECORD, I AM AMANDA ARNES, THE DIRECTOR OF UTILITIES FOR THE TOWN. THIS EVENING, I AM REQUESTING YOUR CONSIDERATION TO AWARD A CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT FOR PHASE 2 OF THE DEEP INJECTION WELL SYSTEM PROJECT. THE COMMUNITY INVESTMENT PROGRAM FOR THE DEEP INJECTION WELL SYSTEM WAS ORIGINALLY ADOPTED IN 2022. REFINEMENTS TO SCOPE AND BUDGET WERE MADE IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS WITH THE MOST RECENT BEING DURING THE FISCAL YEAR 2026 CIP. NUMEROUS MILESTONES HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED IN THE LAST THREE YEARS FOR THIS PROJECT, AND THIS SLIDE ON THE SCREEN ILLUSTRATES THE MILESTONES COMPLETED TO DATE AND A LOOK AHEAD TOWARDS COMPLETION OF THE ENTIRE CFP PROJECT IN THE SUMMER OF 2027. A BRIEF REVIEW OF THE MILESTONES IN ENTERING INTO A CONTRACT FOR PROFESSIONAL CONSULTING SERVICES FOR THE FULL SCOPE OF THE CIP PROJECT WITH JA GEOSCIENCES IN EARLY 2023. COMPLETING DESIGN, OBTAINING REGULATORY PERMITS, AND RECEIVING PROPOSALS FOR BOTH CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS, PHASES 1 AND PHASE 2. PHASE 1 CONSISTED OF SITE PREPARATION AND DRILLING OF THE DEEP INJECTION WELL AND THE ASSOCIATED DUAL ZONE MONITORING WELL. PHASE 2, WHICH IS THE CONTRACT BEFORE YOU WILL CONSIST OF FINAL WELL HEADS FOR BOTH OF THE WELLS, SITE PIPING, AND PUMP STATIONS TO ROUTE THE WATER TO THE DEEP INJECTION WELL, AND FUNCTIONAL TESTING TO PLACE THE WELLS INTO SERVICE. DRILLING OF THE WELLS BEGAN IN DECEMBER OF 2023, AND THE DRILLING CONTRACTOR, YOUNG QUIST BROTHERS, HAS ACHIEVED SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETION ON BOTH THE DEEP INJECTION WELL AND THE DUAL ZONE MONITORING WELL. THEY HAVE DONE THIS FOUR MONTHS AHEAD OF THE PROJECTED SCHEDULE. THEY ARE CURRENTLY WORKING TOWARDS SITE RESTORATION AND INJECTION TESTING FOR PERMIT COMPLIANCE, WHICH THEY EXPECT TO COMPLETE IN EARLY 2026, WHICH WOULD BE POSSIBLY FOUR TO FIVE MONTHS OF THE FINAL CONTRACT COMPLETION DEADLINE. TONIGHT WE ARE SEEKING APPROVAL FOR THE FINAL CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT, WHICH IS PHASE 2, THAT WILL ENABLE US TO PLACE THE DEEP INJECTION WELL AND THE DUAL ZONE MONITORING WELL INTO SERVICE AND FURTHER COMPLY WITH THE FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS ORDER TO CEASE RO TREATMENT BY PRODUCT OR CONCENTRATE DISPOSAL VIA SERVICE WATER DISCHARGE PERMIT. IF THE CONTRACT IS AWARDED TONIGHT, WE EXPECT THAT PHASE 2 IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE COMPLETED IN MAY OF 2027, I'M SORRY. YOU MIGHT NOTICE ON THE CIP PROJECT THAT OUR CURRENT ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER OR PERMIT FROM FDEP HAS A COMPLETION DATE OF DECEMBER 2026. WHEN WE STARTED CONSTRUCTION OF THE WELLS, WE HAVE BEEN REQUIRED AND HAVE BEEN SUBMITTING QUARTERLY REPORTS TO DEP TO KEEP THEM UPDATED ON THE PROGRESS OF CONSTRUCTION. WITH OUR NEXT THEY'RE AWARE OF THE PROGRESS OF THE PROJECT, AND WE WOULD JUST SUBMIT A MINOR MODIFICATION TO OUR PERMIT TO REQUEST AN EXTENSION TO CEASE THE SURFACE WATER OUTFALL DISCHARGES, TO COMPLY OR AGREE WITH THE CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULE. AS LONG AS WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS TOWARD THAT END, THEY HAVE BEEN SUPPORTIVE. ONCE WE DO PLACE THE DEEP INJECTION WELL AND THE DUAL MONITORING WELL INTO SERVICE, THEY WILL REMAIN THEY WILL OPERATE UNDER OUR CONSTRUCTION PERMIT FOR ONE YEAR, AND THEN AT THAT TIME, WE WILL TRANSITION THE PERMIT TO AN OPERATING PERMIT WITH DEP. CONSTRUCTION OF THE PHASE 2 IMPROVEMENTS IS COMPLEX WITH HIGH RISK, IF IT'S NOT EXECUTED PROPERLY AND CAREFULLY. IT INVOLVES MULTI DISCIPLINE INDUSTRIAL CONSTRUCTION, INCLUDING ELECTRICAL, MECHANICAL, STRUCTURAL, INSTRUMENTATION, CONTROLS, AND SITE CIVIL WORK. IT INVOLVES NEW INSTALLATIONS, MODIFICATIONS TO EXISTING CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE, HEAVILY CONGESTED PIPE CORRIDORS, EXTENDED EQUIPMENT LEAD TIMES, ALL WHILE KEEPING PLANT PROCESSES IN SERVICE, AND MINIMIZING DISRUPTION TO EXISTING OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE FUNCTIONS. WE DID PUT OUT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, AND SCOTT REYNOLDS, OUR FINANCE DIRECTOR IS GOING TO DISCUSS THAT. >> THANK YOU, AMANDA. SCOTT REYNOLDS, THE FINANCE DIRECTOR FOR THE TOWN OF JUPITER. [NOISE] TWO THINGS, WE DID GO OUT FOR PROPOSALS. WE RECEIVED TWO PROPOSALS, WHICH WERE EVALUATED BY A SELECTION COMMITTEE OF STAFF AND OUR CONSULTANTS. THE SELECTION COMMITTEE THEY RANKED LAWRENCE LEE CONSTRUCTION SERVICES AS THE MOST QUALIFIED CONTRACTOR TO AWARD BASED ON THE RANKINGS. JUST SO IT'S UNDERSTOOD THAT THE TYPE OF PROCUREMENT WAS THE BEST VALUE PROCUREMENT. IT WASN'T SOLELY BASED JUST ON COST. IT WAS BASED ON A POINT SYSTEM WITH THE COST BEING ONE OF THE HEAVIEST WEIGHTED OF THOSE POINTS AT 30 POINTS. THEY REVIEWED AND EVALUATED LAWRENCE'S PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE WITH SIMILAR TYPE PROJECTS, AND THEY DID REFERENCE CHECKS, WHICH ALL CAME BACK EXCELLENT. THE PROPOSED FUNDING OPTIONS, IT IS BEING REQUESTED FOR A BUDGET AMENDMENT OF $3.2 MILLION BASED ON THE PROPOSAL THAT'S BEEN RECEIVED. [NOISE] AT THE END OF FY 25, I WILL TELL YOU WE HAVE ADDITIONAL R&R FUNDS ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT WE HAD TARGETED. WE DO HAVE JUST OVER ALMOST SIX MILLION DOLLARS ADDITIONAL R&R FUNDING TO FUND THE SHORTFALL. THAT'S BEING REQUESTED THIS EVENING. BUT YOU CAN SEE THE ORIGINAL CIP PROJECT BUDGET WAS JUST OVER $30 MILLION. THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL NEED FOR 3.2. YOU CAN SEE THE ENCUMBRANCES AND WHAT'S BEEN SPENT TO DATE UNDERNEATH THE $24 MILLION. THE CONTRACT THAT'S BEING REQUESTED FOR THIS EVENING FOR LAWRENCE LEE CONSTRUCTION AS $8.7 MILLION WITH SOME FUNDS FOR CONTINGENCY. AGAIN, TOTAL REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING OF 3.2, WHICH WILL COME FROM THE ADDITIONAL R&R FUNDING AT THE END OF FY 25. >> THANK YOU, SCOTT. THE ESTIMATED BUDGET DEVELOPED FOR THE PROJECT WAS LAST UPDATED IN MAY OF 2025 DURING THE FISCAL YEAR 2026 CIP BUDGET PROCESS. AT THAT TIME, DESIGN WAS SUFFICIENTLY COMPLETE AND THE DESIGN ENGINEER PROVIDED A DETAILED OPINION OF PROBABLE CONSTRUCTION COST BASED ON INPUT FROM MATERIAL AND EQUIPMENT SUPPLIERS, AND LABOR AND EQUIPMENT COSTS FROM OTHER SIMILAR TYPE AND RECENT CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. AT THAT TIME, BOTH TOWN STAFF AND THE DESIGN ENGINEER FELT THAT THE OPINION OF PROBABLE CONSTRUCTION COST WAS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SCOPE OF WORK AND CONSTRUCTION MARKET INDUSTRY, AND THE CIP BUDGET WAS INCREASED TO REFLECT THE UPDATED COSTS. THE INCREASED CONSTRUCTION PRICING IN ONLY FIVE MONTHS, AS REPRESENTED BY THE PRICING RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFP IS A TESTAMENT OF THE EXTREME VOLATILITY IN THE CONSTRUCTION MARKET FOR INDUSTRIAL LABOR MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT. PIPE AND VALVE MATERIALS FOR THIS PROJECT ARE PREDOMINANTLY REQUIRED TO BE HIGH GRADE STAINLESS STEEL FOR CORROSION RESISTANCE. A COMPARISON OF BID PRICING TO THE COST ESTIMATE REVEALED THAT PIPE AND VALVE COSTS ARE NOW 20 HIGHER, PUMP COSTS ARE NOW 10 PERCENT HIGHER, ELECTRICAL COSTS ARE 77 PERCENT HIGHER, AND CONSTRUCTION LABOR FOR THIS TYPE OF PROJECT HAS NEARLY DOUBLED. TARIFFS AS HIGH AS 50% ARE HAVING A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON STAINLESS STEEL AND ELECTRICAL MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING COPPER, STEEL, WIRING, PANELS, AND TRANSFORMERS, LEADING TO THESE HIGHER PROJECT COSTS, LONGER DELAYS, AND SHRINKING MARGINS FOR CONTRACTORS. OTHER FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE INCREASE IN COST IS THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS PROJECT, WHICH HAS INHERENT RISK WORKING IN CROWDED UTILITY CORRIDORS WITH CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. FOR EXAMPLE, REROUTING EXISTING PIPING TO THE DEEP INJECTION WELL WILL REQUIRE THE CONTRACTOR TO NAVIGATE MORE THAN 25 UTILITY CONFLICTS IN LESS THAN 300 FEET. LONG MATERIAL LEAD TIMES ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO THE INCREASED COSTS AS CONSTRUCTION DURATIONS ARE EXTENDED. FEEDBACK THAT WE RECEIVED FROM OTHER CONTRACTORS WHO DID NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS FOR THE PROJECT, REPORTED THAT THE PROJECT WAS EITHER TOO LARGE FOR THEM, TOO SMALL FOR THEM OR TOO COMPLEX FOR THEM TO TAKE ON AT THIS TIME, CONSIDERING THEIR OTHER WORKLOADS. WHILE OTHER QUALIFIED CONTRACTORS FOR THIS TYPE OF INDUSTRIAL MUNICIPAL WORK ARE BIDDING ONLY CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AT RISK OR DESIGN BUILD CONTRACTS. A SURVEY OF OTHER UTILITIES IN FLORIDA CONSTRUCTING DEEP INJECTION WELLS REVEALED CONSTRUCTION COSTS VARYING FROM $20.2 MILLION IN 2023 TO $48 MILLION. OURS IS 33. HISTORICALLY, THE WATER UTILITY HAS REFERENCED THE US BUREAU OF LABOR AND STATISTICS CONSUMER PRICE INDEX FOR ALL URBAN CONSUMERS, I KNOW THAT'S A LOT, BUT IT'S THE CPIU, COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE CPIU. WE HAVE TYPICALLY AND HISTORICALLY RELIED ON THE CPIU FOR INDEXING OUR CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS FOR FUTURE BUDGETS. THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT WE DON'T LOOK AT EACH PROJECT, THAT EACH PROJECT IN DETAIL TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR CONSTRUCTION PRICING IS CORRECT, BUT FOR THOSE PROJECTS THAT ARE FIVE YEARS OUT, WE TYPICALLY APPLY THE CPIU. BUT WE'RE FINDING THAT THE CPIU IS NOT SUFFICIENT, ESPECIALLY FOR PROJECTS IN OUR AREA OR FLORIDA, ESPECIALLY FOR INDUSTRIAL TYPE MUNICIPAL PROJECTS. WE DID CONDUCT A REVIEW OF OUR CONSTRUCTION COSTS FROM HISTORICAL PROJECTS, WHICH WE INCLUDED IN THE AGENDA PACKET, AND IT REVEALED THAT CONSTRUCTION INDICES ARE ONLY EXPLAINING A PORTION OF THE INFLATIONARY COSTS FOR OUR INDUSTRY, AND THAT ACTUAL ANNUAL INFLATION RATES ARE MUCH HIGHER BASED ON ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION COSTS RANGING FROM 7% TO AS HIGH AS 24%. WE FEEL THAT REBIDDING THE CONTRACT WILL LIKELY RESULT IN HIGHER PRICING AND WILL RESULT IN FURTHER DELAY OF THE PROJECT SCHEDULE. SOME KEY TAKEAWAYS, PROPOSALS WERE RECEIVED AND EVALUATED ACCORDING TO THE TOWN'S PROCUREMENT PURCHASING POLICY. LAWRENCE LEE CONSTRUCTION SERVICES WAS RANKED BY THE SELECTION COMMITTEE TO BE THE MOST QUALIFIED CONTRACTOR BASED ON THE PROPOSAL RANKING AND THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED. LAWRENCE LEE HAS HAD AN EXPERIENCE MODIFICATION RATIO BELOW ONE FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS INDICATING THEIR ATTENTION TO A SAFETY, AND JUST A REMINDER, THE EXPERIENCE MODIFICATION RATIO MEASURES A COMPANY'S WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIMS AGAINST THE AVERAGE FOR A SIMILAR BUSINESS, SO ANYTHING BELOW ONE IS GOOD. [LAUGHTER] RESOLUTION 104-25 BEFORE YOU, PROVIDES FOR AWARD OF A CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT TO LAWRENCE LEE CONSTRUCTION SERVICES FOR AN AMOUNT OF $8,769,000 AND AN INCREASE TO THE CIP PROJECT BUDGET OF $3,216,563. FUNDING IS AVAILABLE IN THE WATER ENTERPRISE RENEWAL AND REPLACEMENT FUND TO MEET THE BUDGET NEED. COMPLETION OF THIS CONTRACT, WE'LL SEE SURFACE WATER DISCHARGES OF REVERSE OSMOSIS CONCENTRATE TO THE C-18 CANAL AND IMPROVE WATER QUALITY IN THE LOXAHATCHEE RIVER. WITH THAT, I'LL TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. >> I'LL START WITH COUNSELOR CHOY, QUESTIONS. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AS I SIT HERE AND I GO THROUGH WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING, I JUST WANT TO REITERATE AGAIN THAT WE'RE WORKING FROM POLICY AND PROCEDURES. BEAR WITH ME IF I ASK A QUESTION THAT YOU'VE ALREADY GONE THROUGH. YOU IN THE PRE-BID MEETING, THERE WERE FIVE INVITEES AND ONLY TWO AND ONE BEING LAWRENCE LEE, WHO ENDED UP WITH THE CONTRACT, AM I CORRECT? >> CORRECT. FOR THIS PROJECT BECAUSE OF ITS COMPLEXITY, WE HAD A MANDATORY PRE-BID MEETING, WHICH HAD YOU ATTEND THE PRE-BID MEETING IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR SUBMITTING A PROPOSAL. >> CORRECT. >> WE HAD FIVE ATTEND THE MANDATORY MEETING AND TWO SUBMITTED PROPOSALS. >> THE THREE THAT CHOSE NOT TO WERE FOR THE VARIOUS REASONS THAT YOU'VE ALREADY STATED COST AND SO FORTH? >> YES. >> FOR VARIOUS REASONS. >> THE PROCESS WAS HARD FOR THEM, TOO LARGE FOR THEM, OR THEY WERE TOO BUSY AT THE TIME. >> MR. REYNOLDS HAS ALREADY TALKED ABOUT WHERE THE THREE MILLION PLUS IS COMING FROM, CORRECT? >> CORRECT. THEIR MINIMUM REPLACEMENT. >> BUT AGAIN, I'M JUST TRYING TO FOLLOW POLICY AND PROCEDURES HERE AS WE GO THROUGH IT. THANK YOU. >> FIRST MAYOR. >> WE'RE IN A PERFECT STORM OF CONSTRUCTION COST INCREASES, SO I'M NOT SHOCKED WITH THE INCREASES. ONE QUESTION IS NOT OFF THE SUBJECT, BUT WHAT'S THE LIFE EXPECTANCY ONCE THIS IS COMPLETED OF THIS SYSTEM, AND DOWN THE ROAD, WHAT UPGRADES IS IT GOING TO NEED THEM? >> THE DEEP INJECTION WELL ITSELF HAS A SERVICE LIFE OF 50 YEARS. THIS STAINLESS STEEL PIPE AND EQUIPMENT WILL HAVE TO BE MAINTAINED AS LONG AS WE TAKE CARE OF IT ON A REGULAR BASIS. >> DEPENDING ON THE GRADE OF STAINLESS STEEL ALSO. >> CORRECT. >> IS THERE A SUPER HIGH GRADE STAINLESS? >> YES. IT'S SUPER DUPLEX. IN SOME LOCATIONS AND IN OTHER LOCATIONS, IT'S JUST STAINLESS STEEL 316. >> THANK YOU. >> COUNSEL DAN SINGER? >> YES. CAN YOU REMIND ME OF WHAT WAS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO BIDS IN TERMS OF PRICE? IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE? >> IT WAS JUST IT WAS JUST OVER FIVE PERCENT. IT WAS ABOUT A $500,000 DIFFERENCE. FIVE PERCENT BETWEEN THE TWO. >> A VERY SMALL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO. I'M UNFAMILIAR WITH SOME OF THE PROCUREMENT VEHICLES THAT YOU LISTED. I KNOW YOU TALKED ABOUT CMAR, AND THOSE ARE GETTING MORE BIDS, BUT THEY ALSO CAN DRIVE PRICE BECAUSE THEY'RE SOLELY BASED ON EXPERIENCE AND PERFORMANCE, IS THAT RIGHT? >> CMAR, CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AT RISK IS TYPICALLY BASED SOLELY ON A CONTRACTORS QUALIFICATIONS. ONCE THE SELECTION COMMITTEE SELECTS A CONTRACTOR BASED ON QUALIFICATIONS, THEN THEY WOULD NEGOTIATE PRICING. IN SOME CASES, YOU'LL HAVE A POOL OF CONTRACTORS AND MAYBE YOU'LL SHORTLIST THEM AND NEGOTIATE, ASK REQUEST FOR PRICE PROPOSALS FROM EACH OF THEM. BUT TYPICALLY, IN STANDARD CMAR, YOU ARE AWARDING A CONTRACT AND THEN NEGOTIATING PRICE. >> YOU MAY HAVE MORE BIDDERS, BUT IT WOULD POTENTIALLY BE AT A HIGHER PRICE POINT? >> IT COULD, THE BENEFITS OF CMAR IS THAT IT'S TYPICALLY A HIGHER PRICE, BUT THE CONTRACTOR IS INCENTIVIZED TO REDUCE CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULE. ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES IN MY OPINION OF DOING THAT WITH THE TYPE OF WORK THAT WE DO IS SOME OF IT IS A DESIGN BUILDS WE'RE AT THE MERCY OF THE CONTRACTOR AND THE WAY HE WANTS TO DO IT. NOT TO SAY WE DON'T HAVE INPUT INTO IT, BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY DESIGNED TO OUR STANDARDS. WE HAVE NOT DONE CMAR FOR OUR PLANT PROCESSES. >> I COULD SEE THAT GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS AND THIS ISN'T ONE OF THE BUSIEST PARTS OF TOWN. OUR WATER UTILITY IS SURROUNDED BY SHOPPING CENTERS, BY RESIDENTIAL, BY THE HIGHWAY. WE SAW THE DEEP INJECTION WALL CONSTRUCTION GOING ON. THREE HUNDRED UTILITY OR WHAT WAS IT? TWENTY FIVE UTILITY CONFLICT AND 300 FEET. >> I HAVE PUT A LOT OF STUFF ONTO THAT SITE. >> AN OUTSIDER LOOKING IN, I SEE A PHASE 1 AND PHASE 2, YOU WERE SAYING FOR SOME CONTRACTORS, IT'S TOO LARGE OF A PROJECT, FOR OTHERS TOO SMALL. IS THERE A WAY THIS COULD BE BROKEN UP, OR IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE? I'M NOT A WATER EXPERT. >> THE REASON WE BROKE PHASE 1 APART FROM PHASE 2, BECAUSE SOME UTILITIES WOULD DO THAT ALL AS ONE PROJECT. THE REASON WE DID THAT IS BECAUSE WE KNOW PHASE 1 WAS A WELL DRILLER. WE FELT WE WOULD NOT BE EXPERIENCING A MARKUP. IF A GENERAL CONTRACTOR HAD WON THE PROJECT AND NEEDED TO HIRE A WELL DRILLER AND THEN OTHER SUBS, WE WOULD BE PAYING A MARK UP ON THE DRILLING CONTRACTOR. SPLITTING THE CONTRACTS, WE FELT THAT WAS A MORE ECONOMICAL APPROACH TO THIS PROJECT. SPLITTING PHASE 2, THE ONLY WAY I COULD SEE TO DO IT WOULD BE TO SPLIT THE UNDERGROUND WORK APART FROM EVERYTHING ABOVE GROUND. THAT GETS COMPLICATED BECAUSE THEN YOU COULD HAVE FINGER POINTING WHEN THE ABOVE GROUND CONTRACTOR COMES IN AND THE UNDERGROUND CONTRACTOR DID PUT SOMETHING IN THE PLACE THAT HE WANTED. IT WOULD BE EASIER FOR ME TO HAVE ONE CONTRACTOR DOING THE UNDERGROUND AND THE ABOVE GROUND SO THAT THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT, AND THERE'S NO FINGER POINTING. >> WE HAVE SUCH A TIGHT DEADLINE. >> AND SCHEDULE, RIGHT. >> [INAUDIBLE] I'VE BEEN GRATEFUL FOR THE EXTENSIONS. IT'S NICE TO HEAR. NO MORE QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME. >> JUST A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS, DIRECTOR BARNES. ON YOUR EXECUTIVE SUMMARY, I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR APPROVAL AND AWARD OF A CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT TO LAWRENCE LEE CONSTRUCTION FOR, I THINK, $8,769,000. BUT UNDER THE AMOUNT OF THIS REQUEST, YOU HAVE 9,205,000. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE AT $435,000? >> IF YOU LOOK ON ATTACHMENT 6 IS THE PROJECT BUDGET. THE CONTRACT TO LAWRENCE LEE IS 08,769,000 AND THEN THERE'S $5,000 ALLOCATED FOR PERMITTING, CLOSING OUT THE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS AND OTHER PERMIT REQUIREMENTS. THERE'S GEOTECHNICAL TESTING, SO DENSITY TESTING THAT WILL NEED TO BE CONDUCTED DURING CONSTRUCTION. WE'VE ALLOCATED SOME COSTS FOR THAT, AND THEN WE HAVE A 5% CONSTRUCTION CONTINGENCY. >> ANOTHER QUESTION. I UNDERSTAND YOU WANT TO TRANSFER THE 3.2 MILLION CHANGE FROM YOUR WATER RENEWAL AND REPLACEMENT FUND, WHICH IS RIGHT NOW AT 5.8 MILLION. THAT LEAVES YOU WITH $2.6 MILLION REMAINING IN THE FUND. THAT STARTS IN 2026. >> HOW MUCH HAVE YOU BUDGETED OF THAT FUND FOR 2026 FOR OTHER CIP PROJECTS? >> THESE ARE ACTUALLY ADDITIONAL ABOVE AND BEYOND. THEY ARE. AT THE END OF FY25, SEPTEMBER 30TH, THERE WAS ADDITIONAL RNR FUNDS TO BE TRANSFERRED INTO THE RNR FUND FROM THE OPERATING FUND. WE HAD ACCUMULATED ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM USER FEES AND CHARGES. THERE WERE SOME SAVINGS AS FAR AS THE BUDGET GOES. WE HAD THESE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO BE ABLE TO TRANSFER TO THE RNR FUND, WHICH WILL HELP FUND THE SHORTAGE OF THE 3.2 MILLION THAT YOU'RE SEEING THERE. >> NO IMPACT ANY CFE PROJECTS FOR NEXT YEAR THOUGH. >> ABSOLUTELY NOT. IN FACT [OVERLAPPING] >> ALWAYS A LEARNING OPPORTUNITY FOR ME. THANK YOU. APPRECIATE IT. NO FURTHER QUESTION. >> JUST ONE QUESTION AS A FOLLOW UP TO WHAT COUNCIL TYSON HAD ASKED IN YOUR RESPONSE. IN THE BID PRICE, THE REQUESTED CONTRACT AWARD, AND IT WAS IN THE RFP TO BE DONE THIS WAY, THERE'S AN ALLOWANCE OF A QUARTER MILLION DOLLAR FOR UNDEFINED CONDITIONS. THAT EFFECTIVELY IS CONTINGENCY, CORRECT? THEY'RE NOT ENTITLED TO IT. >> CORRECT. >> YOU'VE ALREADY CONTRACTED FOR THE FIRST AMOUNT OF SURPRISES FOR ANY DEBATE TO BE FOUND. I JUST WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT. >> YES. IT'S AN ALLOWANCE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO SUBMIT A PROPOSAL TO US FOR. WE WOULD HAVE TO REVIEW IT AND APPROVE IT. ANYTHING REMAINING IN THAT ALLOWANCE GETS RETURNED TO THE TOWN BY A DEDUCTIVE CHANGE ORDER AT THE END OF THE PROJECT. >> I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS UP HERE. IS THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT? >> NO, SIR. >> TURNING TO COUNCIL. I JUST HAVE SOME COMMENTS TO MAKE. NUMBER 1, I AGREE GENERALLY WITH THE CONTRACTING APPROACH. I BELIEVE I HAVE THE MOST EXPERIENCE IN THE ROOM ON CONTRACTING THIS TYPE OF WORK FROM 46 YEARS WITH FBL. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE DESIGN-BUILD APPROACH IS OFTEN USED WHEN YOU'RE WITHIN A COMPLEX PLANT SITUATION BECAUSE YOU REALLY MANAGE ALL OF THE, WHAT I'D CALL THE TECHNICAL AND OPERATIONAL RISK BY MAKING SURE THE DESIGN IS DONE SPECS OR COVER YOU. THAT THEN SHOULD, IF DONE RIGHT, LIMIT THE RISK TO PURE CONSTRUCTION. I JUST WANT TO POINT THAT OUT. THESE OTHER ALTERNATIVE METHODS ARE MOOT BECAUSE WE HAD PROCEEDED WITH THE DESIGN. I ALSO THINK THAT THE CONSTRUCTION MANAGER AT RISK, WHICH WE'VE USED SUCCESSFULLY FOR PROJECTS LIKE THIS BUILDING, THE POLICE STATION, FIRE STATIONS. THOSE ARE DIFFERENT, BUT I'M NOT SURE YOU WOULD HAVE ENOUGH BIDDERS EFFECTIVELY FOR IT IN PLANT TYPE OF PROJECT. I'M JUST SAYING THAT FROM HAVING DECADES OF OPERATIONAL EXPERIENCE WITH PLANTS. ANYWAY, MY COMMENTS, NUMBER 1, I'M REALLY SPEAKING TO MY COLLEAGUES HERE, THE RECOMMENDED CONTRACT AWARD FOR 08,000,769 REQUIRES A BUDGET INCREASE OF 3.2 MILLION, WHICH WE'VE HEARD. NOW THAT REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT 54% INCREASE VERSUS THAT WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN THE FISCAL YEAR CIP BUDGET PLAN THAT WE ADOPTED A MERE THREE MONTHS AGO. IN TOTAL, THE OVERALL COST FOR THIS PROJECT HAVE INCREASED $8 MILLION SINCE ADOPTION OF THE 24 CIP BUDGET PLAN. I ONLY SHARE THAT AS A POINT OF PERSPECTIVE. IT IS WHAT IT IS. THE TOWN COUNCIL MEETING AGENDA PACKAGE WAS MISSING FUNDAMENTAL INFORMATION THAT I HAD TO REQUEST. I THINK YOU'VE ALL HAVE GOT COPIES. BID PROPOSAL EVALUATION CRITERIA TO THE COMPLETED BID COST PROPOSAL FOR ALL OTHER EVALUATED BIDDERS, IN THIS CASE, THERE WAS ONLY ONE. THE PROPOSAL EVALUATION OF SCORING SHEETS FOR EACH BID EVALUATION TEAM MEMBER. KIMLEY-HORN'S OPINION OF PROBABLE COST FOR THE PHASE 2 WORK PRIOR TO RECEIPT OF BID PROPOSALS, AND THEN KIMLEY-HORN'S EVALUATION OF BID PRICING VERSUS ITS PRE-BID OPINION OF PROBABLE COSTS. I'D LIKE TO INFLUENCE FUTURE SITUATION. I'M GOING TO ASK THAT THE TOWN MANAGER AND STAFF PROVIDE THE FIRST THREE ITEMS FOR ALL FUTURE REQUESTED CONTRACT AWARDS BASED ON THE BEST VALUE OF PROCUREMENT METHOD. THIS HAS NOT BEEN CONSISTENTLY DONE BETWEEN DEPARTMENTS AND NOW WITH THE PROCUREMENT MANAGER, I TRUST IT CAN HAPPEN. BUT I'M ALWAYS GOING TO NEED THAT TO SEE THAT AND I WOULD EXPECT ALL OF US WE WANT TO KNOW, SOMETIMES WE SEE THE COST, SOMETIMES WE DON'T. WE DIDN'T ON THIS ONE. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE EVALUATION CRITERIA WAS. ENOUGH SAT ON THAT. THEN THE LAST TWO ITEMS ABOUT OPINION AND PROBABLE COST IN EVALUATION OF THE COSTS, THOSE SHOULD ALWAYS BE PROVIDED FOR CONTRACT REWARDS THAT REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT BUDGET FUNDING INCREASES. THAT'S THE PURPOSE FOR DOING THAT. I JUST WANT TO ASK THAT IN THE FUTURE, THAT'S AUTOMATICALLY PROVIDED AS INFORMATION BECAUSE I THINK THAT WE NEED THAT AS A COUNCIL TO FEEL LIKE WE UNDERSTAND WHERE WE'RE AT. I RECEIVED THE REQUESTED INFORMATION, AND I KNOW IT WAS FORWARDED EVERYBODY, ALONG WITH A REMINDER FROM THE TOWN FINANCE DIRECTOR, THAT SOLICITATION WAS CONDUCTED AS A BEST VALUE OF PROCUREMENT, NOT A LOW BID AWARD. THAT UNDER THAT METHOD, THE TOWN IS REQUIRED TO AWARD TO THE HIGHEST RANKING VENDOR, NOT NECESSARILY LOW BIDDER, AND A SEPARATE JUSTIFICATION FOR NOT AWARDING TO THE LOWEST BIDDER IS NOT REQUIRED BY TOWN PROCUREMENT PROCEDURES. BY THE WAY, I DID NOT NEED THAT REMINDER. I KNEW WHAT THAT WAS. GOVERNMENTAL BEST VALUE PROCUREMENT PRACTICES OFTEN, IN MY OPINION AND OBSERVATION, DO NOT PLACE APPROPRIATE IMPORTANCE ON THE OVERALL COST IMPACTS TO THE PUBLIC. PUBLISH LOW BID EVALUATION WEIGHTINGS FOR COST REDUCE BIDDER MOTIVATIONS TO PROVIDE COST COMPETITIVE PRICING BECAUSE I REALIZE THEY CAN GET MORE POINTS DOING OTHER THINGS, AND THEY CAN ALSO LEAD TO REDUCTIONS IN THE NUMBER OF BIDDERS SUBMITTING PROPOSALS. ONE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES I'M COMPELLED NOT TO SUPPORT AND NOT TO APPROVE THE REQUESTED BUDGET INCREASE OF 3.2 MILLION, AND IF AT LEAST TWO OTHER COUNCIL MEMBERS WOULD AGREE, THEN THE REQUESTED CONTRACT AWARD WOULD BE DENIED OR AT LEAST POSTPONED PENDING STAFF CONSIDERATION OF ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO REDUCE PROJECT COSTS. THERE MAY BE NO SUPPORT FOR THAT. I'M SPEAKING TO MY COLLEAGUES HERE. GOVERNMENTAL PRACTICES FOR BEST VALUE PROCUREMENT CONTRACTING MAY NOT REQUIRE A SEPARATE JUSTIFICATION FOR NOT AWARDING THE LOWEST BIDDER, BUT IN THIS CASE, THE SECOND BIDDER ON THIS PROJECT HAD A COST THAT WAS A HALF MILLION DOLLAR LOWER THAN STAFF'S HIGHEST RANKING BIDDER. I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER, WHAT COST SAVINGS AMOUNT AND/OR WHAT BUDGET SHORTFALL DOLLAR AMOUNT THRESHOLDS SHOULD IT TAKE TO CHANGE SOME OF THE TOWN'S BEST VALUE PROCUREMENT PRACTICES? THIS REQUESTED CONTRACT AWARD AND HUGE BUDGET INCREASE REQUEST ARE ABOVE MY FISCAL MANAGEMENT THRESHOLDS FOR ACTION AND PERHAPS FOR OTHER TOWN COUNCIL MEMBERS. AT A LAST TOWN COUNCIL MEETING, THERE WERE TWO CONTRACT AWARD AGENDA ITEMS THAT RELIED UPON BEST VALUE PROCUREMENT APPROACHES. THE SELECTION CRITERIA FOR GENERAL CONTRACTING AWARDS ASSIGNED A WEIGHTING OF 70% TO COST. I ACTUALLY COMMENTED ABOUT IT AT LAST MEETING. IN CONTRAST, THE SELECTION CRITERIA FOR THIS CONTRACT ASSIGNED A WEIGHTING OF ONLY 30% TO COST. THE DIFFERENCES IN SELECTION CRITERIA, IMPORTANCE WEIGHTING FOR COST ARE SIGNIFICANT AND VERY IMPACTFUL. I ANALYZE STAFF'S BID EVALUATION SCORES AND HAVE TWO TAKEAWAYS. THE HALF MILLION DOLLAR LOWER COST BENEFIT WAS VALUED AT LESS THAN 4% OF THE MAXIMUM PROPOSAL EVALUATION SCORE. HAD STAFF USED A WEIGHTING OF 55% OR HIGHER FOR THE COST, THE SECOND AND LOWER PRICE BIDDER WOULD HAVE BEEN DEEMED THE HIGHEST RANKED VENDOR. ONE OF THE FIVE STAFF MEMBERS BID EVALUATIONS DID ALREADY RANKED THE LOWEST BIDDER AS THE HIGHEST RANKED BIDDER. I SHARE IT IS JUST BECAUSE AS AN APPROACH, I START WITH ACCEPTING THE EVALUATIONS DONE AND NOT DEBATING HOW THEY CHOSE TO WADE IN INDIVIDUAL ITEM. BUT JUST IN MY EXPERIENCE, KNOWING THAT COST OF THE CUSTOMER IS SO HIGH THAT I WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE A 30%. THE PROJECT USED A DESIGN BID BILL CONTRACTING APPROACH, A MULTI-ENGINEERING CONSULTANTS TEAM WAS USED WITH OVER 2.3 MILLION CONTRACTED COSTS FOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES. THE ENGINEERING TEAM DEVELOPED THE OVERALL DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION SPECIFICATIONS USED FOR BIDDING, THE CONSTRUCTION WORK. THIS APPROACH, IN LARGE PART, ENSURES THE COMPLETED PROJECT WILL MEET ALL WATER PLAN OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS. IT'S BEEN MY 46-YEAR WORK EXPERIENCE THAT BID EVALUATIONS FOR CONSTRUCTION WORK WERE OFTEN PERFORMED SOLELY, NOT IN THE TOWN, PERHAPS, BUT ELSEWHERE ARE PERFORMED SOLELY BY THOSE ACCOUNTABLE TO OVERSEE AND MANAGE THE CONTRACTOR'S ASSIGNED WORK. THEN I THINK, AND I'VE SEEN IT AND IT'S HELPFUL, ALONG WITH A PROCUREMENT SPECIALIST. THE CONTRACTOR BID PRICES ARE ASSIGNED A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER BID EVALUATION WEIGHTING THAN 30% USED IN THIS CASE. BY THE WAY, I'M NOT ADVOCATING FOR THE SECOND BIDDER IN THIS CASE. I'M JUST STATING. LASTLY, THE TOWN'S PRACTICE TO SECURE KIMLEY-HORN'S OPINION OF PROBABLE CAUSE PROVIDES A FUNDAMENTALLY IMPORTANT BENCHMARK COMPARISON TO ASCERTAIN THE COST COMPETITIVE OF BID PROPOSALS. EVERYBODY CAN HAVE AN OPINION ABOUT THIS, BUT THE $3 MILLION DIFFERENCE IN KIMLEY-HORN'S PRE-CONSTRUCTION COST ESTIMATE AND BID PROPOSAL PRICES REPRESENTED A SIGNIFICANT RED FLAG TO ME AND HOPEFULLY OTHERS ON TOWN COUNCIL. THIS SHOULD BE, IN MY OPINION, TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT BEFORE AWARDING A CONTRACT TO THE STAFF TO THE HIGHEST RANK VENDOR. WE HAVE A DECISION TO MAKE TONIGHT. WE CAN INCREASE THE BUDGET, FORGE AHEAD WITH THE PROJECT THAT HAS THE HIGHEST COST IMPACT POTENTIALLY, BUT IT BRINGS CERTAINTY AND MOVE AHEAD WITH THE PROJECT. JUST THAT BASED ON MY FISCAL MANAGEMENT VALUES AND PUBLIC SERVICE OBLIGATIONS, I'M JUST COMPELLED NOT TO SUPPORT AND NOT TO APPROVE THE $3.2 MILLION PROJECT BUDGET INCREASE BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE SOME ACTION, VALUE ENGINEER, AND REBID IT AGGRESSIVELY. MY EXPERIENCE, WHEN YOU REALLY WANT TO GET BIDDERS, YOU HAVE MULTIPLE PRE-BID MEETINGS, YOU DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO GET PEOPLE TO BID ON THE PROJECT. I BELIEVE IF YOU SHOW A HIGHER COST VALUE RATING CRITERIA, THEN THEY RECOGNIZE TO WIN THE JOB. THEY GOT TO BE COMPETITIVE IN PRICE AS OPPOSED TO KNOW THEY CAN WIN ON OTHER ATTRIBUTES. IF AT LEAST TWO OTHER COUNCIL MEMBERS WERE TO AGREE, THEN THE REQUESTED CONTRACT AWARD WOULD BE DENIED OR AT LEAST POSTPONED PENDING STAFF CONSIDERATION OF ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO REDUCE PROJECT COSTS. I APPRECIATE THE WORK STAFF DID. I SAID I GENERALLY AGREED WITH THE CONTRACTING APPROACH. IT JUST MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN DIFFERENT ON WHAT YOU ASSIGNED THE COST. IN FACT, I TELL YOU AS A PROJECT MANAGER, I PROCEEDED MANY TIMES WITH NOT THE CONTRACT I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO PROCEED WITH, AND I KNEW I WAS TAKEN ON HEADACHES AS A PROJECT MANAGER. BUT AS A PROJECT MANAGER, MY JOB WAS TO DELIVER A SUCCESSFUL PROJECT AT THE LOWEST COST. OVERWHELMINGLY, IT WAS ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL, MAYBE MORE HEADACHES IN MANAGING IT, BUT EVERYTHING WAS DELIVERED, HAS TO BE BY DEFINITION, TO MEET PLAN OPERATIONS REQUESTS. WITH THAT, I TURN IT BACK TO MY COLLEAGUES. NEXT PERSON WANT TO COMMENT. >> THE WAY I VIEW THIS IS THAT WE HAVE AN FDEP PERMIT FOR OUR CURRENT DISPOSAL METHOD THAT'S RUNNING OUT OR WE'RE EVEN GETTING EXTENSIONS TO GET THE WORK DONE. THERE IS A TIGHT DEADLINE. I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THE LUXURY ON THIS. I THINK WATER IS HEALTH AND SAFETY. I THINK TIME IS VERY LIMITED IN WHAT WE CAN DO. I THINK THE COST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO BIDDERS WAS NOT A VERY BIG DIFFERENCE, WHICH SAYS SOMETHING. I DID ASK ABOUT THE ENGINEER'S ESTIMATE. I KNOW IT WAS A SURPRISE TO THEM, BUT I'M ALSO NOT SURPRISED, AS OTHERS HAVE SAID THAT COSTS ARE GOING UP AND THE VOLATILITY IS VERY HIGH IN THIS INDUSTRY. I'VE SEEN THAT MULTIPLE TIMES EVEN SINCE THE CIP DISCUSSIONS THIS SUMMER WHEN I FIRST ASKED FOR A LOT OF THIS INFORMATION. I LOOKED AT THE EVALUATIONS PROVIDED, AND I DO ASK FOR THAT DETAIL, BUT NOT ALL THE TIME. I THINK ON A BIG PROJECT LIKE THIS, IT'S WARRANTED AND WE NEED TO. I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT TO DRILL SO DEEP UNLESS IT IS AN ESPECIALLY LARGE PROJECT, OR I SEE RED FLAGS. BUT IN THIS CASE, THE DETAIL WAS PROVIDED. I LOOKED AT THE EVALUATIONS, AND THE PERFORMANCE PIECE OF IT WAS CONCERNING ON THE SECOND BIDDER, I'LL SAY. TO THINK OF 25 CONFLICTS AND 300 FEET IN DOWNTOWN JUPITER IN A VERY BUSY SPOT WITH THE MOST TRAFFIC, THE HIGHEST TRAFFIC QUADRANT. I THINK ABOUT WHAT THE COST COULD BE IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT GOES WRONG IN A PROJECT, THIS COMPLEX, SO COMPLEX THAT BIDDERS AREN'T BIDDING ON IT. COST OR NO COST. NO MATTER WHAT THE CRITERIA ARE, THE NATURE OF THE WORK IS IN SOME WAYS DICTATING THE NUMBER OF BIDDERS WE GET IN THIS MARKET FOR INDUSTRIAL. >> I THOUGHT THAT WAS INTERESTING. I THOUGHT THE LEVEL OF DETAIL PROVIDED IN THE PROPOSALS. I DID GO AND LOOK AT SOME OF THE CRITERIA. I KNOW THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT PROCUREMENT VEHICLES, AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO TALK ABOUT THE CIP AND REFINE IT. BUT I'M CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO HOLD THIS UP. I THINK IT'S REALLY CRITICAL THAT WE GET THIS DONE. I THINK THAT WE HAVE DONE A PRETTY GOOD JOB WITH OUR EVALUATION PROGRAM, AND I'M SATISFIED WITH WHAT I READ IN THE EVALUATIONS, AND I CERTAINLY LEARNED A LOT FROM THEM. I'M VERY CAREFUL ABOUT PERFORMANCE IN THIS CONTRACT. I AM ABOUT COST AS WELL, AND I'M GRATEFUL THAT WE HAVE THE R&R TO COVER IT IN THIS CASE. I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING WE CAN ALWAYS LOOK AT IN THE FUTURE, BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH IT. I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY LUXURY ON THIS. I THINK STAFF DID A GREAT JOB. I'M SATISFIED WITH THE EVALUATIONS. I THINK I WOULD HAVE MADE THE SAME DECISION AND THAT'S ALL I'D SAY. >> I WANT TO JUST, NOT DEBATING. I RESPECT EVERYBODY'S WE ALL HAVE TO MAKE OUR DECISIONS. NUMBER 1, I USE THE TERM TABLE BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THERE IS A GOOD POSSIBILITY THAT THE FDP WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE AT A POINT AND WITH THE BIDS BEING SO HIGHER THAN EXPECTED THAT THEY WOULD BE OPEN TO THE IDEA THAT IF WE WERE TO DECIDE THAT WE WANTED TO REBID IT. WE'D HAVE TO ASK THEM THAT, SO WE DON'T KNOW THAT TONIGHT. NUMBER 2, THEY KNOW THAT WHEN WE TOOK ON THIS PROJECT, THEY KNEW HOW YOU REALLY CAN'T COMPARE DEEP INJECTION ALL PROJECTS BECAUSE THE DEPTH OF THE INJECT THERE'S SO MANY BIG VARIABLES. YOU CAN'T NONE ARE ALL, THEY FUNDAMENTALLY ARE DEEP INJECTION, BUT THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT'S COMMON ABOUT THEM. BUT WE'RE TOLD THAT FDP WAS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE PROJECT. THEY KNEW IT WAS A SIGNIFICANT COST, AND IN FACT, EARLY ON, WE WERE WHEN IT WAS THE PROJECT WAS 24 MILLION, WE THOUGHT WE'RE GOING TO GET FDP FUNDING ASSISTANCE, WHICH WE NEVER GOT. AGAIN, AND I WASN'T ADVOCATING TO JUST GIVE IT TO THE SECOND BIDDER. BECAUSE I THINK EVIDENCE IS WE DIDN'T GET COMPETITIVE BIDS, PERIOD. I EXPECTED MORE FROM OUR CONSULTANT ENGINEER, AND I DIDN'T NECESSARILY WANT TO GET IN THIS, BUT JUST EXPLAIN BECAUSE FROM MY EXPERIENCE, A TRUE EVALUATION THAT I WOULD EXPECT FROM THEM IS THEY LOOK AT THE COMPONENTS OF WHY THEIR COSTS WAS DIFFERENT. THEY WOULD LOOK IN THE RFP AND CONCLUDE, WAS IT CLEAR? WAS THE SCOPE CLEAR OR WAS IT MAYBE VAGUE ENOUGH THAT THE CONTRACTOR HAD TO PUT ALL SORTS OF CONTINGENCY IN. I CAN TELL YOU WHEN I GET A COMPLEX PLANT PROJECT, WE WENT TO EXTRAORDINARY EFFORTS TO MAKE SURE WE DEFINED EVERYTHING CRYSTAL CLEAR SO A BIDDER COULD COME IN AND REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE FACING. I REALIZE THAT'S NOT A PERFECTLY DONE, BUT THERE'S AN EFFORT ON IT. I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED IF WE WERE TO TAKE A TIME OUT THAT OUR CONSULTANT COULD GO BACK AND LOOK WHERE THE PRICES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER, AND THEY'RE THE ONES THAT PUT THE SPEC IN THE SCOPE DEFINITION TOGETHER TO LOOK. SEE, IF IT'S A LOT HIGHER, COULD THERE BE A MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT THIS? IF THEY COME BACK AND SAY, I CAN SEE IT NOW, WE CAN IMPROVE THAT, THAT INCREASES THE CHANCES OF THEM GETTING MORE COMPETITIVE PRICING. BUT THOSE ARE THE STEPS THAT WE'D HAVE TO TAKE, BUT IN ANY EVENT, I JUST WANT TO EXPLAIN THAT. >> DIDN'T WE DO THAT STEP IN THAT PART OF THE PRE BID MEETING WE HAD WITH THE FIVE DIFFERENT CONTRACTORS GO THROUGH THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL? THAT HELPS US FORMULATE OUR PROPOSAL GOING OUT TO THEM, RIGHT? MAKE SURE THEY UNDERSTAND. >> I HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT, BUT, THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH THAT CAN BE SAID IN THE PRE BID MEETING. THE REST OF IT'S IN THE DOCUMENT. >> MAYOR ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE BIDDERS DIDN'T KNOW THE COMPLEXITY AND THE SCOPE OF THE JOB? >> NO. I'M JUST SAYING THAT IF I WAS THE ENGINEER OR THE ENGINEER WAS WORKING DIRECTLY FOR ME WHEN I WAS THE PROJECT MANAGER. IS I WOULD CHALLENGE THEM SAYING, LOOK, IT'S ALMOST 50+% HIGHER THAN YOU SAID. WHAT'S THE REASON FOR THE DIFFERENCE? THAT'S WHAT I HAD ASKED FOR. I JUST WANT TO SEE WHAT HIS OPINION WAS. ALL THEY DID WAS IN SOME CASE, SAY, WELL, THE BIDDER BID HIGHER THAN WE HAD. THAT'S NOT AN EXPLANATION. YOU TRY TO DO A DEEP DIVE OF IS THERE A CAUSAL FACTOR? DID WE MISS SOMETHING OR NOT? IN ONE CASE, THE ENGINEER SAID, HEY, THERE'S A SCOPE INCREASE WE DIDN'T ACCOUNT FOR. THAT'S UNDERSTOOD. THE OTHER ITEMS HE DIDN'T. I'M JUST SAYING IT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE ON COMPLEX PROJECTS. >> I MEAN, SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE, THIS IS THE MOST COMPLEX, UNIQUE PROJECT I THINK WE'VE DISCUSSED OR LOOKED AT. BUT ALSO, I MEAN, MISS BARNES MENTIONED THAT THE COST INCREASE OF THE MATERIALS AND THE AGE THAT WE'RE LIVING IN, IT'S ACROSS THE WHOLE ECONOMY. I MEAN, TO ME, THAT'S WHERE THE INCREASES AND I MEAN, I'M SURE THE CONTRACTORS DIDN'T BID ON THIS BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T GOING TO MAKE ENOUGH MONEY. THEY'RE TOO BUSY TO SPREAD TOOTH AND IT'S ALL DENT DIFFERENT ARIAS, WHY THEY DIDN'T JUMP IN. BUT YOU'RE SAYING BECAUSE THE WAY WE'RE WAITING THINGS YOU DON'T THINK THE WAY WE WAIT, THE BIDDING PROCESS. [OVERLAPPING] >> IF YOU BIDDER, YOU LOOK AT THE POINTS. ON THE BEST VALUE PROCUREMENT, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET CREDIT FOR? HECK, I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M GOING TO GET THE MOST POINTS I CAN, TO WIN THE EVALUATION. UNDER THAT, TYPICALLY, THE CONTRACTOR IS GOING TO WIN IT. BECAUSE YOU KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THEM WHERE SOMEBODY NEW COMING IN HAS A INHERENT DISADVANTAGE. I JUST TELL YOU INCLINATIONS. I'VE EXPERIENCED MY 46 YEARS. >> I UNDERSTAND YOU. I APPRECIATE YOUR EXPERIENCE. I JUST TRYING TO-. >> CAN I ASK YOU SPEAK TO SOME OF THAT IN TERMS OF THE PRE BID MEETING. I KNOW WE HAD SPOKEN ABOUT THAT EARLIER, COUNCIL MEMBER [INAUDIBLE] AND [INAUDIBLE]. >> AMANDA BARNETTOR UTILITIES. THE PLANS AND SPECS ARE DETAILED. WE DID COMPLETE A DETAILED DESIGN OF THE PROJECT. WE DID EXPLAIN THE PROJECT TO THE ATTENDEES AT THE PRE BID MEETING AND WE DID CONDUCT A [INAUDIBLE] VISIT. DURING THE DESIGN PROCESS, WE DID VALUE ENGINEER THE PROJECT AND WE REDUCED PROJECT COSTS BY NEARLY 2 MILLION, MAYBE $2.2 MILLION. I DON'T REMEMBER THE EXACT NUMBER RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE WE HAVE DONE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF VALUE ENGINEERING ON THIS PROJECT, AND I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE WE COULD VALUE ENGINEER OUT OF IT. >> IT'S HELPFUL TO CONFIRM THAT LEVEL. I KNOW YOU HAD SPOKEN ABOUT YOU HAD FIVE DIFFERENT OPTIONS FOR A VERY SPECIFIC PART. YOU AND I HAD SPOKEN ABOUT THIS EARLIER TODAY. I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER THE EXACT. MAYBE I'LL LEAVE IT. BUT NO, I'M GRATEFUL FOR THAT CONFIRMATION. THANK YOU. >> AS I SIT HERE, I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I AM NOT AN ENGINEER. I TAKE WHAT I'VE BEEN GIVEN. I'VE EVALUATED IT. WE'VE HEARD WHY THERE WERE ONLY TWO OUT OF THE FIVE ON THE PRE BID. I'VE GOTTEN THE EXPLANATION ON THE 3 MILLION WHERE THIS MONEY IS COMING FROM. I THINK OF OUR RESIDENTS, THE SAFETY, THE CALIBER OF THE FOLKS THAT YOU'RE HIRING, AND I WOULD SUPPORT THIS. WILL THERE BE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES FOR PROCUREMENT CHANGES THAT MAY NEED TO BE DONE? QUITE FRANKLY, IT COULD BE, I DON'T KNOW, BUT I AM NOT AN ENGINEER, AND I HAVE TO RELY ON WHAT'S GIVEN TO ME BY THE STAFF WHO KNOWS AND UNDERSTANDS. AGAIN, THE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS THAT I EVEN STARTED WITH IN THE BEGINNING, REGARDING THE PRE BID, I'M SATISFIED WITH THE ANSWERS THAT I'VE GIVEN. >> I'LL MAKE A MOTION TO APPROVE. >> SECOND. >> I HAVE A MOTION IN THE SECOND. ANY DISCUSSION? SEEING NONE. ALL IN FAVOR SIGNIFY BY SAYING AYE. >> AYE >> AYE. >> OPPOSED NAY. THE MOTION CARRIES FOUR TO ONE WITH MAYOR KRITSKI DISSENTING. MOVING ON TO REPORTS, TOWN ATTORNEY. >> THANK YOU, MAYOR. ON FRIDAY OF THIS WEEK, THERE WILL BE A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION HEARING, ON THE SENATE BILL 180 LAWSUIT. THE CITIES THAT ARE PARTICIPATING IN THAT HAD TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS TO FILE DECLARATIONS, WHICH IS ANOTHER NAME FOR AN AFFIDAVIT IN SUPPORT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT'S POSITION IN THAT LITIGATION. I SUBMITTED A DECLARATION ON BEHALF OF THE TOWN OF JUPITER. I ALSO SUBMITTED ONE ON BEHALF OF THE TOWN OF LAKE PARK. AT A HEARING THIS MORNING THE JUDGE RULED THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE LIVE TESTIMONY. APPARENTLY, AT THIS POINT, THE JUDGE HAS RULED OUT TESTIMONY BY ZOOM, WHICH MEANS THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE PROVIDED DECLARATIONS BECAUSE A DECLARATION IS FROM AN EVIDENTIARY STANDPOINT, IT IS NOT LIVE TESTIMONY, ALTHOUGH IT'S TESTIMONY UNDER OATH, AND SO IT CAN BE CONSIDERED AS HEARSAY TESTIMONY. WE DON'T WANT TO SUPPORT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT'S POSITION SOLELY BY HEARSAY TESTIMONY. AT ANY RATE, SOME COMMUNICATIONS I HAVE WITH LEAD COUNSEL THIS AFTERNOON, IT MAY BE UNLESS THE JUDGE REVISITS HIS OPINION AND I'M TOLD THAT'S A POSSIBILITY. I MAY BE TRAVELING TO TALLAHASSEE THURSDAY TO PROVIDE SOME LIVE TESTIMONY ON FRIDAY. I'M HOPING THAT'S NOT THE CASE BECAUSE IT ESSENTIALLY TAKES TWO DAYS OUT OF THE WEEK TO GO TO TALLAHASSEE, SPEND THE NIGHT, GIVE A HALF HOUR OF TESTIMONY AND DRIVE BACK. BUT I WILL LET YOU KNOW, AS YOU KNOW, AND AS I KNOW, THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT CASE. THE LEGISLATION THAT'S BEEN PRE FILED IN TALLAHASSEE THAT, IS SUPPOSEDLY GOING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES IN SENATE BILL 180. FROM MY REVIEW OF THAT LEGISLATION, IT ADDRESSES A FEW ISSUES, BUT IT REALLY DOESN'T GET TO THE CORE ISSUE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OF HOME RULE, AND THEIR AUTHORITY TO MAKE DETERMINATIONS OF WHEN AND HOW, FOR EXAMPLE, TO AMEND YOUR COMPREHENSIVE PLANS TO ADDRESS ISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS. PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION HEARINGS, FOR THE MOST PART, ARE HEARINGS THAT DECIDE CASES. THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT IN ORDER TO PREVAIL ON A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION MOTION, YOU HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE TO THE COURT THAT THERE'S A LIKELIHOOD THAT YOU'RE GOING TO PREVAIL ON THE MERITS OF THE CASE. IT'S ONE OF THE THREE STANDARDS THAT HAVE TO BE PROVEN. IF A JUDGE FINDS THAT YOU'VE DEMONSTRATED THAT YOU'RE GOING TO THERE'S A LIKELIHOOD THAT YOU'RE GOING TO PREVAIL ON THE MERITS OF A CASE, THAT SAME JUDGE IS LIKELY TO MAKE A DECISION THAT YOU PREVAIL. ON THE OTHER HAND, IF THE JUDGE'S DECISION IS, IT'S NOT LIKELY, THAT YOU CAN PREVAIL ON THE MERITS OF THE CASE FOR PURPOSES OF THAT PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION. IT'S ALSO NOT LIKELY AT THE FINAL HEARING THAT THE JUDGE WILL RULE IN YOUR FAVOR. I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I COULD BE HUMPING IN MY SLEIGH, ON THURSDAY AND MAKING THE TRICK. NORTH, NOT GOING AS FAR AS THE NORTH POLE, BUT STILL GOING NORTH. >> QUESTION. MAYBE YOU SAID IT, BUT I'M NOT SURE I HEARD IT. I READ AN ARTICLE ONLINE, WHICH IS PROBABLY THE WORST PLACE TO GET INFORMATION BECAUSE IS THE ISSUE THE FIRST ISSUE WHERE THE STATE WAS SUGGESTING THAT NO ONE HAS STANDING, AND THEN THAT WAS THE FIRST ISSUE OF THE HEARING. THEN THE INJECTION HEARING ONLY HAPPENS IF WE PASSED THE STANDING ISSUE. WHAT CAN YOU COMMENT ABOUT THAT? >> THE STATE HAS ASSERTED THAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DON'T HAVE STANDING. THAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF REQUIRING THE DECLARATIONS. THE DECLARATIONS, AND THE LIVE TESTIMONY, IF NOT A DECLARATION, DO GO TO THIS ISSUE IN PART OF STANDING. THEY ALSO GO TO THE MERITS OF THE LEGISLATION, BUT WITHOUT STANDING, YOU DON'T GO ANY FURTHER. THAT'S WHY THESE DECLARATIONS WERE IMPORTANT AND THAT'S WHY THIS HEARING IS IMPORTANT. OTHER THAN THAT, I WILL SAY MERRY CHRISTMAS, HAPPY HOLIDAYS. IF I DON'T SEE YOU BEFORE THEN. SEE YOU NEXT YEAR. >> BEFORE YOU LEAVE YOUR REPORT, I JUST WANT TO STATE ON BEHALF OF I THINK I CAN SPEAK ON BEHALF OF ALL CONFIDE COUNSEL. WE HAVE MOST CONFIDENCE IN YOU, AND IF YOU GIVE TESTIMONY, WE EXPECT YOU TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR AND THE JUDGE WILL ASSERT APPROVE STANDING. THANK YOU. >> I'LL DO MY BEST. >> TOWN MANAGER. >> THANK YOU, MAYOR. COUPLE OF THINGS ON MY REPORT. FIRST OF ALL, I HAD MENTIONED IT AT THE LAST MEETING, BUT I'M PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE THAT THE OFFICERS AND SERGEANTS OF THE JUPITER POLICE DEPARTMENT HAVE RATIFIED THE CONTRACT THAT THE TOWN. THE PBA HAVE NEGOTIATED. IT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A YEAR. I WANT TO THANK THIS COUNCIL FOR THEIR COMMITMENT TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. I'M SPEAKING NOW AS A TOWN MANAGER AS A TENURED POLICE CHIEF WITH, MORE THAN A DECADE AS THE CHIEF OF THE JUPITER POLICE DEPARTMENT. I'VE I'VE NEVER SEEN A CONTRACT LIKE THIS. THIS COUNCIL'S COMMITMENT TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT IS JUST REMARKABLE. I WANT TO THANK THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE JUPITER POLICE DEPARTMENT. FOR THEIR VOTE, THE CONTRACTS THE TWO AGREEMENTS, WERE APPROVED WITH MORE THAN 85% VOTING IN FAVOR OF THE CONTRACT. THE RATIFICATION BY THE OFFICERS WAS THE FIRST STEP IN THE CONTRACT APPROVAL PROCESS. I WILL TELL YOU THAT AGAIN, THE COMMITMENT OF THIS COUNCIL BECAUSE THE PREVIOUS CONTRACT HAD ALREADY EXPIRED, THERE THERE WAS NO REQUIREMENT FOR THIS COUNCIL, TO FALL BACK TO THE CONTENTS OF THAT CONTRACT. HOWEVER THIS COUNCIL HAS AUTHORIZED ME, TO GO BACK AND HONOR SOME SIGNIFICANT PIECES OF THAT PREVIOUS CONTRACT. THE FIRST OF WHICH IS THE CLOTHING ALLOWANCE THAT EACH OFFICER GETS, AS PART OF THAT OLD AGREEMENT, BASED ON THE FACT THAT THE CONTRACT HAS BEEN RATIFIED. I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT, AND THOSE FUNDS WILL BE RELEASED AND THE OFFICERS WILL HAVE THEM IN THEIR CHECKS BY FRIDAY. THAT IS A BIG ONE FOR THEM. THE OTHER THING, I WILL TELL YOU THAT BASED ON THE APPROVAL, I'LL BE BRINGING THE CONTRACT FORWARD TO YOU WITH MORE DETAILS AT THE JANUARY 6 MEETING. IN TERMS OF SCHEDULE, WHAT WE PLAN ON DOING AT THE MOMENT WILL BRING YOU THE CONTRACT ON JANUARY 6. IF YOU APPROVE THE CONTRACT, THEN THE FIRST PAY CHECK AFTER THAT MEETING, THE OFFICERS WILL GET THEIR NEW GO TO THEIR NEW PAY RATES AND WE GET THEM ALL SETTLED IN AND THE CHECK RIGHT BEHIND THAT, BECAUSE SOMETHING ELSE THAT YOU ALL HAVE APPROVED, THEY'LL BE GETTING THEIR RETROACTIVE PAY BACK TO OCTOBER 1 WHEN THIS CONTRACT SHOULD HAVE GONE INTO EFFECT. THE FINAL TAKEAWAY WHEN YOU ADD IT ALL UP AND THE RETIREMENT ISSUES AND GETTING RID OF THAT TIER 2, ALL THE THINGS THAT THIS COUNCIL HAS DONE HAS JUST BEEN TRULY REMARKABLE. I'M GLAD IT'S DONE, AND WE GET TO MOVE FORWARD FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS, AND THANK YOU TO THE OFFICERS AND THE PBA AND ALL THOSE THAT WERE INVOLVED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> ALSO, YESTERDAY, THE TOWN LAUNCHED A NEW PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST PORTAL CALLED JUSTFOIA. THIS PORTAL WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TO SUBMIT AND TRACK THE PROGRESS OF A PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST. THE PORTAL ALLOWS USERS TO MAKE SECURE ONLINE PAYMENTS AND TO EASILY DOWNLOAD THE REQUESTED RECORDS. INDIVIDUALS WISHING TO MAKE PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST CAN FIND OUT MORE AND ACCESS THE SYSTEM BY VISITING THE TOWN'S WEBSITE. ON DECEMBER 10, THE JUPITER POLICE DEPARTMENT BEGAN ITS ANNUAL DRIVE SOBER OR GET PULLED OVER CAMPAIGN, WHICH WILL RUN THROUGH JANUARY 1. DURING THIS CAMPAIGN, OFFICERS WILL CONDUCT ADDITIONAL IMPAIRED DRIVING ENFORCEMENT THROUGHOUT TOWN TO ENCOURAGE SAFE DRIVING DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON. FINALLY, I WANT TO RECOGNIZE. WELL, I GOT TWO THINGS. I WANT TO RECOGNIZE SOME OF OUR EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE RECENTLY CELEBRATED SIGNIFICANT MILESTONES OF SERVICE WITH THE TOWN. A DIRECTOR OF PLANNING ZONING JOHN SICKLER, WHO'S IN THE BACK OVER THERE, AND DAVID ROTAR, BOTH RECENTLY REACHED 30 YEARS OF SERVICE TO OUR COMMUNITY WITH THE TOWN. THANK YOU, JOHN, WE APPRECIATE THAT. WHEN I WAS AT THE CELEBRATION OF THE DAY, I WAS REALLY SURPRISED TO SEE HOW MANY 30-YEAR EMPLOYEES WE HAVE. IT'S ALMOST TO THE POINT WE HAVE TO START CLUB 30. WE WON'T, MAYOR. BUT THERE WERE QUITE A FEW THAT HAD 30 YEARS OF SERVICE. ALSO, KEVIN ALBON, A SERVICE WORKER TECHNICIAN IN PUBLIC WORKS, RECENTLY CELEBRATED 20 YEARS OF SERVICE. FINALLY, PAUL ROMERO AND CHARLES BARKER OF THE UTILITIES DEPARTMENT, AS WELL AS OFFICERS TYLER ROBICHAUD AND IRIS STAN OF THE JUPITER POLICE DEPARTMENT, ALL RECENTLY CELEBRATED FIVE YEARS OF SERVICE WITH THE TOWN, SO THEY'RE ON THEIR JOURNEY. FINALLY, I JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK THE COUNCIL, THIS IS OUR LAST MEETING OF THE YEAR, FOR ALL THE SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE AND ALL THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET DONE THIS YEAR BASED ON YOUR LEADERSHIP. I WANT TO THANK THE TOWN STAFF. IT'S BEEN A RELENTLESS YEAR. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT 2026 IS GOING TO BE SLOWER, BUT IT'S NOT. THE STAFF HAS JUST BEEN REMARKABLE. WHEN YOU JUST THINK ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED OVER THE LAST YEAR, WHETHER IT'S FROM JFRD, SHIFTING TO GET ALL THOSE PLAYGROUNDS DONE, UTILITIES PROJECTS, PARKS AND REC, ENGINEERING PROJECTS, E-BIKES, CROSSWALKS. IF YOU LOOK AT MY BOARD IN THE OFFICE, YOU CAN SEE A LOT OF THOSE. IT WAS TRULY REMARKABLE YEAR. THANK YOU TO THE STAFF. I HOPE EVERYBODY HAS MERRY CHRISTMAS, HAPPY HOLIDAYS AND HAPPY NEW YEAR. AS THE TOWN ATTORNEY SAYS, WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT YEAR. THANK YOU, MAYOR. >> I TRY TO ALTERNATE, SO I WANT TO GO COUNCILOR SUNDSTROM FIRST. >> LACK OF PREP. QUESTION, TOWN MANAGER. THE NEW PORTAL FOR PUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS. IF SOME RESIDENTS ARE NOT AS TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED AS OTHERS AND DON'T WANT TO USE THE PORTAL, DO THEY HAVE THE OPTION OF DOING IT ANOTHER WAY? >> THEY DO. THE OLD SYSTEM IS STAYING IN PLACE. >> IT'S JUST FOR CONVENIENCE, NOT A BENEFIT? >> FOR CONVENIENCE. >> I STRUGGLE, REALLY. I JUST MADE THAT GUY UP. I ALSO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE STAFF THAT HAVE BEEN HERE FOR 30 YEARS. I WAS TALKING TO SOMEONE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD IN ABACOA. THEY SAID, AND HOW WAS IT STRUCTURED? I WAS LIKE, BEEN A LONG TIME, BUT WE'RE SO GRATEFUL JUST FOR THE INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND THE WISDOM. THANK YOU FOR CHALLENGING US AND OFFERING DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES FROM THAT LONGER VIEW. I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO HAS STUCK IT OUT. THAT'S NOT EASY TO DO, BUT I HOPE YOU'VE RECEIVED COMPOUND INTEREST ON YOUR INVESTMENT. I HOPE YOU'VE BUILT RELATIONSHIPS THAT YOU VALUE. WE CERTAINLY SEE THE VALUE THAT YOU ADD TO THIS TOWN, JUST DRIVING AROUND. I VIEW THE TOWN DIFFERENTLY NOW. I THINK WHEN I FIRST MOVED HERE AND YOU DRIVE AROUND, YOU DON'T SEE. I SEE EVERY UTILITY POLE AND CONFLICT AND POLICE OFFICER AND THE STORY OF EVERY BUILDING, AND I'M SURE A LOT OF YOU DO AS WELL. I THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT YOU'VE PUT IN. IT HAS BEEN A YEAR. I'M A WORRIED WORRIED. I'M ALREADY WORRIED ABOUT 2026. BUT IT HAS BEEN A WONDERFUL YEAR WITH THE PLAYGROUNDS, ESPECIALLY IT'S BEEN A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE TO GET TO GO THERE AND SEE THAT, BUT ALSO WITH THE FIRE DEPARTMENT TO REALLY SEE THAT COME TO FRUITION AND BE FLESHED OUT. I KNOW WITH THE JTAA PARADE, I WENT TO QUICKLY SAY A QUICK HELLO TO THE FIRE DEPARTMENT BEFORE JUMPING ON THE BACK OF THE CAR TO THROW CANDY. I THINK THEY DOUBLED OR TRIPLED IN SIZE. I'M USED TO THE FIVE OR SIX OF THEM, AND THERE WERE 20 OF THEM, OR SOMETHING CRAZY, SO I WAS GLAD I COULD INTRODUCE MYSELF AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO WITH THEM ALL WHEN THEY'RE HERE. I'D LOVE TO SEE THEM ALL IN ONE PLACE. MAYBE INVITE THEM TO TOWN HALL AND WELCOME THEM. NO, IT'S BEEN A REALLY GOOD YEAR. MERRY CHRISTMAS, HAPPY HANUKKAH, HAPPY MERRY EVERYTHING. I LIKE TO SAY HAPPY NEW YEAR. I THINK IT'S THE GREAT CLEAN SLATE FOR ANYONE WHO NEEDS IT. ONE MORE COMMENT, ACTUALLY, KRISTI, THANK YOU FOR COMING. WE ONLY KNOW WHAT PEOPLE TELL US. MY HUSBAND KEEPS TELLING ME I'M NOT A MIND READER. I WISH YOU WERE. WE'RE NOT EITHER. WE ONLY KNOW WHAT PEOPLE TELL US. UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH YOUR BUSINESS AND WITH THE INLET VILLAGE, I'M REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THAT PERSPECTIVE. THANK YOU FOR THAT, AND I'LL CONTINUE TO THINK ON THAT AS TIME GOES ON. THANK YOU. >> COUNCILOR GEISINGER? >> AGAIN, CONGRATULATIONS TO ALL THE EMPLOYEES. NOT ONLY THOSE IN DECEMBER THAT CELEBRATE ANNIVERSARIES, BUT TO ALL THE EMPLOYEES OUT THE YEAR HAD MAJOR ANNIVERSARIES, WOULD BE FIVE, 25, 20, 25 OR 30. BUT ALSO, I READ SOMETHING IN ONE OF OUR WEEKLY REPORTS REGARDING JUPITER BEING THE FOURTH BEST PLACE TO LIVE IN STATE OF FLORIDA AND 124TH IN US. I'D JUST PERSONALLY LIKE TO THANK ALL THE, FIRST OF ALL, THE TOWN STAFF AND ALL THE EMPLOYEES FOR THEIR DEDICATION AND COMMITMENT TO THE TOWN, AND ITS RESIDENTS THROUGHOUT 2025. YOUR HARD WORK, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, HAS NOT GONE UNNOTICED AND ATTRIBUTED TO JUPITER BEING RECOGNIZED AS BEING ONE OF THE BEST PLACE TO LIVE, NOT ONLY IN FLORIDA BUT ALSO IN THE UNITED STATES, AND THAT'S A TESTAMENT TO ALL THE WORK THAT THESE FOLKS, THESE EMPLOYEES OF THE TOWN PUT IN EVERY DAY TO MAKE IT A GREAT PLACE TO LIVE. THANK YOU. >> I'LL GO NEXT AND THEN GO DOWN THE LINE HERE. NUMBER 1, WE ALL ARE JUST DELIGHTED TO HAVE FINALLY REACHED SUCCESS ON THE POLICE CONTRACT. MR. KITZEROW, YOU'RE ALWAYS KIND IN GIVING CREDIT TO THE COUNCIL AND OTHERS FOR OUR COMMITMENT. BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY HOW GRATEFUL I AM FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW WAY THE PROCESS WORKS. WE HAVE SUNSHINE LAWS, SO WE DON'T TALK TOGETHER ON THIS EXCEPT IN THE MEETING. HE MEETS ONE ON ONE, BUT THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE PROCESS, I KNOW THAT YOU AND STAFF WERE LOOKING FOR HOW WE COULD MOVE RAPIDLY AS AN EXAMPLE ON THE CLOTHING ALLOWANCE PAYOUT, WHICH I KNOW THAT OUR FINANCE DEPARTMENT HAS GOT A LOT OF STUFF TO DO, SO ALL THAT IS AN IMPACT, BUT IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO YOU AND THE STAFF FOR GETTING US TO THAT POINT, AND I HOPE WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED WHAT WE ALL WANTED, IS TO MAKE SURE OUR POLICE FEEL LIKE THEY'RE HIGHLY VALUED AND I BELIEVE BY A VOTE OF APPROVAL, IT DOES INDICATE THAT. I WISH IT WAS 100%, BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS. BUT THANK YOU. I JUST WANT TO REFLECT, SINCE THE LAST MEETING THAT WE'VE HAD TWO EVENTS. WE HAD THE SNOW PLACE LIKE JUPITER. THAT WAS JUST, OH MY GOSH, THAT IS AN INCREDIBLE EVENT. I THINK IT WORKED OUT REALLY NICE TO SEPARATE IT FROM THE TREE LIGHTING, WHICH REGRETTABLY I MISSED BECAUSE I WAS OUT OF TOWN, BECAUSE IT CREATES TWO EVENTS NOW, BUT IT WAS JUST INCREDIBLE THE TURNOUT AND THE ENJOYMENT OF THAT EVENT. IT WARMS MY HEART BECAUSE IT JUST SHOWS HOW WE'RE STILL SUCH A FAMILY ORIENTED COMMUNITY WITH A SMALL TOWN FEEL. I'M THE ONE THAT DOES REMEMBER YEARS BACK WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT MAINTAINING THAT, AND QUITE FRANKLY, HAD NO CLUE HOW YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT. BUT CERTAINLY, STAFF, WITH ALL THE WORK THEY PUT IN WITH THESE EVENTS, HELPS TO DO THAT. THEN JUST THE COMMUNITY AND THEN THE JTAA PARADE WAS JUST INCREDIBLE. I JUST WANT TO THANK JTAA AND SOME OF THE KEY PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN RUNNING IT FOR YEARS, AND WE ALL SAW THAT ONE LONGTIME MEMBER WAS RETIRING FROM THAT ROLE. IT'S HARD TO FIND PEOPLE THAT HAVE GIVEN THEMSELVES FOR 50 YEARS, NEXT PERSON TO STEP UP FOR ANOTHER 50, BUT ANYWAY, JUST GRATEFUL FOR THAT. THEN I JUST WANT TO SAY AS A COMMENT, WITH REGARD TO KIMLEY-HORN, I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THEM HEAR A MESSAGE FROM ME. WE PAY CONSULTANTS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY, AND 2.3 MILLION ON THIS PROJECT, KIMLEY-HORN GOT ALMOST $900,000. THEY MAKE A LOT OF MONEY, SO WE SHOULD BE EXPECTING OUT OF THEM. I JUST WANT TO SHARE, I'VE BEEN DISAPPOINTED WITH A NUMBER OF THINGS WITH KIMLEY-HORN. I'M ON THIS PROJECT BECAUSE WHEN I SAW THEIR EVALUATION, THERE'S SOMETHING THAT WE ALWAYS DID WITH MY OTHER EMPLOYER, WAS WE LOOK IN THE MIRROR FIRST. I DIDN'T SEE ANY OF THAT ON KIMLEY-HORN, SO WE JUST ATTRIBUTED TO OUR PRICES ARE GOING UP. THAT'S NOT WHAT I EXPECT. SOMEONE MAY SAY TO YOU, WELL, IT WAS PERFECT, WHAT WE PUT TOGETHER. THAT'S NOT PERFECT. I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED THAT YOU LOOK LINE BY LINE, AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND, COULD THERE HAVE BEEN MISUNDERSTANDING? BECAUSE THE VALUE THEY THEN COULD HAVE BROUGHT BY GOING OUT WITH A REBID COULD HAVE POTENTIALLY SAVED SIGNIFICANT DOLLARS. THEY WEREN'T PREPARED. I JUST WANT THEM TO KNOW, UNTIL I SEE THEM STEP UP AND COMMIT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO IMPROVE, I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT ANY MORE CONTRACT AWARDS TO THEM, BECAUSE TO ME, I'VE SEEN A DROP OFF IN THE QUALITY OF WHAT WE'RE GETTING FOR THAT. ULTIMATELY, OUR STAFF HAVE TO RELY UPON CONSULTANTS WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT. THEN LASTLY, AS WE'VE ALL SAID, HAPPY HOLIDAY SEASON, HANUKKAH, CHRISTMAS, JUST A WHOLE SEASON, AND I REALLY WISH BEST WISHES TO ALL IN THE NEW YEAR. THANK YOU. >> IT'S BEEN PRETTY EXCITING YEAR, BUSY. TOWN MANAGER, PBA CONTRACT. GREAT TO GET THAT DONE. THANK YOU AND ALL INVOLVED STAFF FOR YOUR INGENUITY, ALL OF YOU. IT'S COMPLICATED BUSINESS. IT TOOK A LONG TIME THIS TIME, BUT I KNEW WE'D GET THERE. WASN'T WORRIED ABOUT. I KNEW WE'D DO THE RIGHT THING. WE ALWAYS TRY TO DO THE RIGHT THING FOR OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT. THAT BEING SAID, THANKS EVERYBODY INVOLVED IN THAT. CHIEF HENNESSY, DOING A GREAT JOB AS OUR INTERIM POLICE CHIEF. TAKEN ON THAT TASK. CHIEF DONATTO. GREAT YEAR. OTHER BUSY ONE COMING UP. FANTASTIC. JOHN SICKLER BACK THERE. YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH VALUE YOU'VE ADDED TO THIS TOWN WITH YOUR EXPERTISE AND WHAT YOU DO. REALLY APPRECIATE ALL YOU DO. ALTHOUGH YOU'RE OUT OF THE BLUE SOMETIMES WITH QUESTIONS AND PROBABLY DRIVE YOU CRAZY, BUT ANYWAY, THANKS THAT YOU'RE HERE. SCOTT REYNOLDS IS ALWAYS. IS HE STILL HERE? THERE HE IS. NEWLY MARRIED. CONGRATULATIONS. BUT GREAT YEAR, ANOTHER BUSY ONE COMING UP. MAYOR, YOU MISSED THE TREE LIGHTING CEREMONY WAS GREAT ON OUR NEW TOWN GREEN, AND A NICE NICE TURNOUT. I WASN'T ABLE TO MAKE THE SNOW EVENT, BUT CAN'T HIT EVERYTHING. THE JTAA PARADE WAS FANTASTIC. ANOTHER GREAT TURNOUT. THERE'S BEEN A LITTLE, I HEARD SOME THINGS SOCIAL MEDIA LIKE, WHY ISN'T IT BACK ON ITS USUAL ROUTE? BUT I GUESS MOST PEOPLE REALLY LIKE THE ABACOA, BECAUSE IT'S SHADED AND IT'S MORE CONDENSED. >> IT'S ALSO THE BRIGHTLINE TRAIN. I RECENTLY LEARNED, AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT EVER GOT SHARED AROUND FACEBOOK, BUT THE BRIGHTLINE CONFLICT, SCHEDULED TRAIN A LOT OF TIME, IT'S VERY RISKY GIVEN THEN CHILDREN. >> BUT PEOPLE WANT TO SEE IT OVER THE NEW BRIDGE BECAUSE THERE'S MORE ROOM AND ALL THAT, WHICH WOULD BE GREAT, BUT THE BRIGHTLINE IS A MAJOR ISSUE. JUST SO PEOPLE KNOW, WE DON'T MAKE THAT DECISION. THERE'S A LOT OF ENTITIES INVOLVED THERE THAT HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT. ANYTHING ELSE HERE? THERE'S A LOT. I THINK THAT'S IT. WELL, MERRY CHRISTMAS, HAPPY HANUKKAH HAPPY NEW YEAR, AND EVERYBODY BE SAFE AND WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT YEAR. >> THANK YOU. FOR ME, PERSONALLY, 2025 HAS BEEN AN EXTRAORDINARY YEAR. MY FIRST YEAR ON THE COUNCIL. I'M LEARNING EVERY SINGLE DAY, AND WITHOUT THE STAFF, AND I INCLUDE OUR NEW FIRE, OUR POLICE, ALL OF THE DIRECTORS, OUR TOWN MANAGER, MY FELLOW COUNCIL MEMBERS. I THOUGHT I KNEW WHAT WAS BEFORE ME, AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU EVERY DAY I KEEP LEARNING. BUT WE DO LIVE IN A TOWN WHERE IT IS ALL FAMILY. PEOPLE THAT YOU DON'T KNOW WILL BECOME YOUR FAMILY. YES, WE'RE GROWING, WE'RE GETTING BIGGER. AS I SAT HERE TONIGHT, I WANT TO PERSONALLY THANK THE PUBLIC, AND KRISTI YOU'RE STILL HERE, FOR YOUR INPUT. THERE'S AN INSIGHT THAT I THINK, MOST OF US WILL SAY WE NEED TO ADDRESS. WHATEVER WE CAN DO, WE'LL CONTINUE TO PURSUE IT. HOLIDAYS BRINGING, I THINK, THE BEST IN EVERYBODY. IN THESE PAST FEW WEEKS, IT HAS BEEN LIKE EVERYDAY IS A CELEBRATION. I THINK IF YOU GO OUT INTO OUR GRAINS OUT THERE, DOESN'T IT LOOK LIKE DISNEYLAND? I'M GOING TO PUT YOU IN THAT SPIRIT THAT WE HAVE A LOT TO BE PROUD OF. I'M VERY PROUD TO SERVE EACH OF YOU ON THIS DAIS. I WISH EVERYONE, A REALLY SERIOUSLY, VERY HAPPY HOLIDAY. BUT MOST OF ALL, A NEW YEAR FILLED WITH ONLY GOOD HEALTH. WITHOUT IT, WE'RE NOT HERE. HAPPY HOLIDAYS. >> I'M JUST GOING TO, AS PREROGATIVE FOR BEING THE CHAIR, ONE LAST ITEM AND WE ALL CAN KEEP COMING UP TO ONE LAST ITEM IN A MEETING LIKE THIS, BUT THE LIGHTHOUSE DECORATION. THE TOWN, TO MY KNOWLEDGE, NEVER HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH LIGHTHOUSE DECORATIONS, BUT THE PUBLIC WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN THEY GOT DISCONTINUED. THEN STAFF STEPPED UP AND WAS ABLE TO, AND I GUESS THE PUBLIC SHOULD KNOW THIS. I KNOW PROBABLY WE ALREADY HAVE A COVERED IN SOCIAL MEDIA, BUT STAFF WENT AHEAD IN THE TOWNS NOW DOING THE DECORATIONS OF THE LIGHTHOUSE. THERE'S A CASE WHERE WE ARE TRYING TO CONTINUE SOMETHING THAT WAS CONSIDERED VERY IMPORTANT TO PROBABLY THE LONGER TENURED MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC. I THINK STAFF, I KNOW THAT WASN'T AN EASY TASK. >> MAYOR, IF I COULD. THAT WAS ROGER HELD. WOULD LIKE TO GIVE HIM CREDIT. >> I KNOW IT WAS, YEAH. >> THANK YOU, ROGER. >> THANK YOU. YOU'RE SO COMMITTED TO THAT. [OVERLAPPING] TO CLIMB UP THE LIGHTHOUSE HIMSELF TO PUT THEM ON THERE. THAT'S OKAY. WE'LL DO THAT. >> WHICH IS WHY I WANTED TO BRING IT UP. I KNOW THAT WAS NO SMALL TASK, AND WE HAD TO GET THROUGH THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN TO BE ABLE TO GET THE AGREEMENT WITH THE LIGHTHOUSE TO BE ABLE TO DO IT. I KNOW HE WAS ON IT EVERY DAY. THANK YOU. WITH THAT, THE TIME IS NOW 8:53 AND WE'LL ADJOURN THE MEETING."
